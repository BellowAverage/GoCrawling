{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "text": " Roboticsis theinterdisciplinarystudy and practice of the design, construction, operation, and use ofrobots.[1] Withinmechanical engineering, robotics is the design and construction of the physical structures of robots, while incomputer science, robotics focuses on robotic automation algorithms. Other disciplines contributing to robotics includeelectrical,control,software,information,electronic,telecommunication,computer,mechatronic, andmaterialsengineering. The goal of most robotics is to design machines that can help and assisthumans. Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring space, mines and shipwrecks. Others replace people in jobs that are boring, repetitive, or unpleasant, such as cleaning, monitoring, transporting, and assembling. Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes. Robotics usually combines three aspects of design work to createrobotsystems: Mechanical construction: a frame, form or shape designed to achieve a particular task. For example, a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud might usecaterpillar tracks. Origami inspired robots can sense and analyze in extreme environments.[2]The mechanical aspect of the robot is mostly the creator's solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it. Form follows function. Electrical components that power and control the machinery. For example, the robot withcaterpillar trackswould need some kind of power to move the tracker treads. That power comes in the form of electricity, which will have to travel through a wire and originate from a battery, a basicelectrical circuit. Even petrol-poweredmachinesthat get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol-powered machines like cars, have batteries. The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound, position, and energy status), and operation (robots need some level ofelectrical energysupplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations) Software. A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something. In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not be able to go anywhere without a program telling it to move. Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly structured, its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all). There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence, and hybrid. A robot withremote controlprogramming has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with remote control. It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics. Robots that useartificial intelligenceinteract with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming. A hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions in them.[3] As more and more robots are designed for specific tasks, this method of classification becomes more relevant. For example, many robots are designed for assembly work, which may not be readily adaptable for other applications. They are termed \"assembly robots\". For seam welding, some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot i.e. the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables, etc. as an integrated unit. Such an integrated robotic system is called a \"welding robot\" even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks. Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation, and are labeled as \"heavy-duty robots\".[4] Current and potential applications include: Manufacturing. Robots have been increasingly used in manufacturing since the 1960s. According to theRobotic Industries AssociationUS data, in 2016 the automotive industry was the main customer of industrial robots with 52% of total sales.[5]In the auto industry, they can amount for more than half of the \"labor\". There are even \"lights off\" factories such as an IBM keyboard manufacturing factory in Texas that was fully automated as early as 2003.[6] Autonomous transportincluding airplaneautopilotandself-driving cars Domestic robotsincludingrobotic vacuum cleaners,robotic lawn mowers, dishwasher loading[7]andflatbread baking.[8] Construction robots. Construction robots can be separated into three types: traditional robots,robotic arm, androbotic exoskeleton.[9] Automated mining. Space exploration, includingMars rovers. Energy applications including cleanup of nuclear contaminated areas;[a]and cleaning solar panel arrays. Medical robotsandRobot-assisted surgerydesigned and used in clinics.[11] Agricultural robots.[12]The use of robots in agriculture is closely linked to the concept ofAI-assistedprecision agricultureanddroneusage.[13] Food processing. Commercial examples of kitchen automation are Flippy (burgers), Zume Pizza (pizza), Cafe X (coffee), Makr Shakr (cocktails), Frobot (frozen yogurts), Sally (salads),[14]salad or food bowl robots manufactured by Dexai (aDraper Laboratoryspinoff, operating on military bases), and integrated food bowl assembly systems manufactured bySpyce Kitchen(acquired bySweetgreen) andSilicon Valleystartup Hyphen.[15]Other examples may include manufacturing technologies based on3D Food Printing. Military robots. Robot sports for entertainment and education, includingRobot combat,Autonomous racing,drone racing, andFIRST Robotics. At present, mostly (lead–acid)batteriesare used as a power source. Many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots. They range from lead–acid batteries, which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver–cadmium batteries which are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive. Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime, andweight. Generators, often some type ofinternal combustion engine, can also be used. However, such designs are often mechanically complex and need fuel, require heat dissipation, and are relatively heavy. A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely. This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere. However, this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot, which can be difficult to manage.[16]Potential power sources could be: pneumatic(compressed gases) Solar power(using the sun's energy and converting it into electrical power) hydraulics(liquids) flywheel energy storage organic garbage (throughanaerobic digestion) nuclear Actuators are the \"muscles\" of a robot, the parts which convertstored energyinto movement.[17]By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear, and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories. There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators, powered by electricity, chemicals, or compressed air. The vast majority of robots useelectric motors, oftenbrushedandbrushless DC motorsin portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots andCNCmachines. These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational. Various types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning, and often have quicker direction changes, particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics. They are typically powered by compressed and oxidized air (pneumatic actuator) or an oil (hydraulic actuator) Linear actuators can also be powered by electricity which usually consists of a motor and a leadscrew. Another common type is a mechanical linear actuator such as a rack and pinion on a car. Series elastic actuation (SEA) relies on the idea of introducing intentional elasticity between the motor actuator and the load for robust force control. Due to the resultant lower reflected inertia, series elastic actuation improves safety when a robot interacts with the environment (e.g., humans or workpieces) or during collisions.[18]Furthermore, it also providesenergy efficiencyand shock absorption (mechanical filtering) while reducing excessive wear on the transmission and other mechanical components. This approach has successfully been employed in various robots, particularly advanced manufacturing robots[19]and walkinghumanoidrobots.[20][21] The controller design of a series elastic actuator is most often performed within thepassivityframework as it ensures the safety of interaction with unstructured environments.[22]Despite its remarkable stability and robustness, this framework suffers from the stringent limitations imposed on the controller which may trade-off performance. The reader is referred to the following survey which summarizes the common controller architectures for SEA along with the correspondingsufficientpassivity conditions.[23]One recent study has derived thenecessary and sufficientpassivity conditions for one of the most commonimpedance controlarchitectures, namely velocity-sourced SEA.[24]This work is of particular importance as it drives the non-conservative passivity bounds in an SEA scheme for the first time which allows a larger selection of control gains. Pneumatic artificial muscles also known as air muscles, are special tubes that expand (typically up to 42%) when air is forced inside them. They are used in some robot applications.[25][26][27] Muscle wire, also known as shape memory alloy, is a material that contracts (under 5%) when electricity is applied. They have been used for some small robot applications.[28][29] EAPs or EPAMs are a plastic material that can contract substantially (up to 380% activation strain) from electricity, and have been used in facial muscles and arms of humanoid robots,[30]and to enable new robots to float,[31]fly, swim or walk.[32] Recent alternatives to DC motors arepiezo motorsorultrasonic motors. These work on a fundamentally different principle, whereby tinypiezoceramicelements, vibrating many thousands of times per second, cause linear or rotary motion. There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line.[33]Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw. The advantages of these motors arenanometerresolution, speed, and available force for their size.[34]These motors are already available commercially and being used on some robots.[35][36] Elastic nanotubes are a promising artificial muscle technology in early-stage experimental development. The absence of defects incarbon nanotubesenables these filaments to deform elastically by several percent, with energy storage levels of perhaps 10J/cm3for metal nanotubes. Human biceps could be replaced with an 8 mm diameter wire of this material. Such compact \"muscle\" might allow future robots to outrun and outjump humans.[37] Sensors allow robots to receive information about a certain measurement of the environment, or internal components. This is essential for robots to perform their tasks, and act upon any changes in the environment to calculate the appropriate response. They are used for various forms of measurements, to give the robots warnings about safety or malfunctions, and to provide real-time information about the task it is performing. Currentroboticandprosthetic handsreceive far lesstactileinformation than the human hand. Recent research has developed a tactilesensor arraythat mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips.[38][39]The sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin. Electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and are connected to an impedance-measuring device within the core. When the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed, producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object. The researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting the robotic grip on held objects. Scientists from severalEuropean countriesandIsraeldeveloped aprosthetichand in 2009, called SmartHand, which functions like a real one —allowing patients to write with it, type on akeyboard, play piano, and perform other fine movements. The prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feelings in its fingertips.[40] Other common forms of sensing in robotics use lidar, radar, and sonar.[41]Lidarmeasures the distance to a target by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflected light with a sensor.Radaruses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects.Sonaruses sound propagation to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water. One of the most common types of end-effectors are \"grippers\". In its simplest manifestation, it consists of just two fingers that can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects. Fingers can, for example, be made of a chain with a metal wire running through it.[42]Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include theShadow Handand theRobonauthand.[43]Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include theDelfthand.[44][45]Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws. Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction. Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction. Suction end-effectors, powered by vacuum generators, are very simple astrictive[46]devices that can hold very large loads provided theprehensionsurface is smooth enough to ensure suction. Pick and place robots for electronic components and for large objects like car windscreens, often use very simple vacuum end-effectors. Suction is a highly used type of end-effector in industry, in part because the naturalcomplianceof soft suction end-effectors can enable a robot to be more robust in the presence of imperfect robotic perception. As an example: consider the case of a robot vision system that estimates the position of a water bottle but has 1 centimeter of error. While this may cause a rigid mechanical gripper to puncture the water bottle, the soft suction end-effector may just bend slightly and conform to the shape of the water bottle surface. Some advanced robots are beginning to use fully humanoid hands, like the Shadow Hand, MANUS,[47]and the Schunk hand.[48]They have powerfulrobot dexterity intelligence (RDI), with as many as 20degrees of freedomand hundreds of tactile sensors.[49] The mechanical structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks.[50]The control of a robot involves three distinct phases –perception, processing, and action (robotic paradigms).[51]Sensorsgive information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its end effector). This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators (motors), which move the mechanical structure to achieve the required co-ordinated motion or force actions. The processing phase can range in complexity. At a reactive level, it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands (e.g. firing motor power electronic gates based directly upon encoder feedback signals to achieve the required torque/velocity of the shaft).Sensor fusionand internal models may first be used to estimate parameters of interest (e.g. the position of the robot's gripper) from noisy sensor data. An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction until an object is detected with a proximity sensor) is sometimes inferred from these estimates. Techniques fromcontrol theoryare generally used to convert the higher-level tasks into individual commands that drive the actuators, most often using kinematic and dynamic models of the mechanical structure.[50][51][52] At longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a \"cognitive\" model.Cognitive modelstry to represent the robot, the world, and how the two interact. Pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects.[50]Mappingtechniques can be used to build maps of the world. Finally,motion planningand otherartificial intelligencetechniques may be used to figure out how to act. For example, a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles, falling over, etc. Modern commercial robotic control systems are highly complex, integrate multiple sensors and effectors, have many interacting degrees-of-freedom (DOF) and require operator interfaces, programming tools and real-time capabilities.[51]They are oftentimes interconnected to wider communication networks and in many cases are now bothIoT-enabled and mobile.[53]Progress towards open architecture, layered, user-friendly and 'intelligent' sensor-based interconnected robots has emerged from earlier concepts related toFlexible Manufacturing Systems(FMS), and several 'open or 'hybrid'reference architecturesexist which assist developers of robot control software and hardware to move beyond traditional, earlier notions of 'closed' robot control systems have been proposed.[52]Open architecture controllers are said to be better able to meet the growing requirements of a wide range of robot users, including system developers, end users and research scientists, and are better positioned to deliver the advanced robotic concepts related toIndustry 4.0.[52]In addition to utilizing many established features of robot controllers, such as position, velocity and force control of end effectors, they also enable IoT interconnection and the implementation of more advanced sensor fusion and control techniques, including adaptive control,Fuzzy controlandArtificial Neural Network(ANN)-based control.[52]When implemented in real-time, such techniques can potentially improve the stability and performance of robots operating in unknown or uncertain environments by enabling the control systems to learn and adapt to environmental changes.[54]There are several examples of reference architectures for robot controllers, and also examples of successful implementations of actual robot controllers developed from them. One example of a generic reference architecture and associated interconnected, open-architecture robot and controller implementation was used in a number of research and development studies, including prototype implementation of novel advanced and intelligent control and environment mapping methods in real-time.[54][55] A definition of robotic manipulation has been provided by Matt Mason as: \"manipulation refers to an agent's control of its environment through selective contact\".[56] Robots need to manipulate objects; pick up, modify, destroy, move or otherwise have an effect. Thus the functional end of a robot arm intended to make the effect (whether a hand, or tool) are often referred to asend effectors,[57]while the \"arm\" is referred to as amanipulator.[58]Most robot arms have replaceable end-effectors, each allowing them to perform some small range of tasks. Some have a fixed manipulator that cannot be replaced, while a few have one very general-purpose manipulator, for example, a humanoid hand.[59] For simplicity, most mobile robots have fourwheelsor a number ofcontinuous tracks. Some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels. These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts, as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to. Balancing robots generally use agyroscopeto detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of aninverted pendulum.[60]Many different balancing robots have been designed.[61]While theSegwayis not commonly thought of as a robot, it can be thought of as a component of a robot, when used as such Segway refer to them as RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform). An example of this use has been asNASA'sRobonautthat has been mounted on a Segway.[62] A one-wheeled balancing robot is an extension of a two-wheeled balancing robot so that it can move in any 2D direction using a round ball as its only wheel. Several one-wheeled balancing robots have been designed recently, such asCarnegie Mellon University's \"Ballbot\" which is the approximate height and width of a person, andTohoku Gakuin University's \"BallIP\".[63]Because of the long, thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces, they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people.[64] Several attempts have been made in robots that are completely inside a spherical ball, either by spinning a weight inside the ball,[65][66]or by rotating the outer shells of the sphere.[67][68]These have also been referred to as anorb bot[69]or a ball bot.[70][71] Using six wheels instead of four wheels can give better traction or grip in outdoor terrain such as on rocky dirt or grass. Tracks provide even more traction than a six-wheeled robot. Tracked wheels behave as if they were made of hundreds of wheels, therefore are very common for outdoor off-road robots, where the robot must drive on very rough terrain. However, they are difficult to use indoors such as on carpets and smooth floors. Examples include NASA's Urban Robot \"Urbie\".[72] Walking is a difficult and dynamic problem to solve. Several robots have been made which can walk reliably on two legs, however, none have yet been made which are as robust as a human. There has been much study on human-inspired walking, such as AMBER lab which was established in 2008 by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University.[73]Many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs, due to these robots being significantly easier to construct.[74][75]Walking robots can be used for uneven terrains, which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods. Typically, robots on two legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk upstairs. None can walk over rocky, uneven terrain. Some of the methods which have been tried are: The zero moment point (ZMP) is the algorithm used by robots such asHonda'sASIMO. The robot's onboard computer tries to keep the totalinertial forces(the combination ofEarth'sgravityand theaccelerationand deceleration of walking), exactly opposed by the floorreaction force(the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot). In this way, the two forces cancel out, leaving nomoment(force causing the robot to rotate and fall over).[76]However, this is not exactly how a human walks, and the difference is obvious to human observers, some of whom have pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs thelavatory.[77][78][79]ASIMO's walking algorithm is not static, and some dynamic balancing is used (see below). However, it still requires a smooth surface to walk on. Several robots, built in the 1980s byMarc Raibertat theMITLeg Laboratory, successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking. Initially, a robot with only one leg, and a very small foot could stay upright simply byhopping. The movement is the same as that of a person on apogo stick. As the robot falls to one side, it would jump slightly in that direction, in order to catch itself.[80]Soon, the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs. A bipedal robot was demonstrated running and even performingsomersaults.[81]Aquadrupedwas also demonstrated which couldtrot, run,pace, and bound.[82]For a full list of these robots, see the MIT Leg Lab Robots page.[83] A more advanced way for a robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm, which is potentially more robust than the Zero Moment Point technique, as it constantly monitors the robot's motion, and places the feet in order to maintain stability.[84]This technique was recently demonstrated byAnybots'Dexter Robot,[85]which is so stable, it can even jump.[86]Another example is theTU Delft Flame. Perhaps the most promising approach usespassive dynamicswhere themomentumof swinging limbs is used for greaterefficiency. It has been shown that totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using onlygravityto propel themselves. Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up ahill. This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.[87][88] A modernpassenger airlineris essentially aflyingrobot, with two humans to manage it. Theautopilotcan control the plane for each stage of the journey, including takeoff, normal flight, and even landing.[89]Other flying robots are uninhabited and are known asunmanned aerial vehicles(UAVs). They can be smaller and lighter without a human pilot on board, and fly into dangerous territory for military surveillance missions. Some can even fire on targets under command. UAVs are also being developed which can fire on targets automatically, without the need for a command from a human. Other flying robots includecruise missiles, theEntomopter, and theEpson micro helicopter robot. Robots such as the Air Penguin, Air Ray, and Air Jelly have lighter-than-air bodies, are propelled by paddles, and are guided by sonar. BFRs take inspiration from flying mammals, birds, or insects. BFRs can have flapping wings, which generate the lift and thrust, or they can be propeller actuated. BFRs with flapping wings have increased stroke efficiencies, increased maneuverability, and reduced energy consumption in comparison to propeller actuated BFRs.[90]Mammal and bird inspired BFRs share similar flight characteristics and design considerations. For instance, both mammal and bird inspired BFRs minimizeedge flutteringandpressure-induced wingtip curlby increasing the rigidity of the wing edge and wingtips. Mammal and insect inspired BFRs can be impact resistant, making them useful in cluttered environments. Mammal inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from bats, but the flying squirrel has also inspired a prototype.[91]Examples of bat inspired BFRs include Bat Bot[92]and the DALER.[93]Mammal inspired BFRs can be designed to be multi-modal; therefore, they're capable of both flight and terrestrial movement. To reduce the impact of landing, shock absorbers can be implemented along the wings.[93]Alternatively, the BFR can pitch up and increase the amount of drag it experiences.[91]By increasing the drag force, the BFR will decelerate and minimize the impact upon grounding. Different land gait patterns can also be implemented.[91] Bird inspired BFRs can take inspiration from raptors, gulls, and everything in-between. Bird inspired BFRs can be feathered to increase the angle of attack range over which the prototype can operate before stalling.[94]The wings of bird inspired BFRs allow for in-plane deformation, and the in-plane wing deformation can be adjusted to maximize flight efficiency depending on the flight gait.[94]An example of a raptor inspired BFR is the prototype by Savastano et al.[95]The prototype has fully deformable flapping wings and is capable of carrying a payload of up to 0.8 kg while performing a parabolic climb, steep descent, and rapid recovery. The gull inspired prototype by Grant et al. accurately mimics the elbow and wrist rotation of gulls, and they find that lift generation is maximized when the elbow and wrist deformations are opposite but equal.[96] Insect inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from beetles or dragonflies. An example of a beetle inspired BFR is the prototype by Phan and Park,[97]and a dragonfly inspired BFR is the prototype by Hu et al.[98]The flapping frequency of insect inspired BFRs are much higher than those of other BFRs; this is because of theaerodynamics of insect flight.[99]Insect inspired BFRs are much smaller than those inspired by mammals or birds, so they are more suitable for dense environments. A class of robots that are biologically inspired, but which do not attempt to mimic biology, are creations such as theEntomopter. Funded byDARPA,NASA, theUnited States Air Force, and theGeorgia Tech Research Instituteand patented by Prof.Robert C. Michelsonfor covert terrestrial missions as well as flight in the lowerMarsatmosphere, the Entomopter flight propulsion system uses lowReynolds numberwings similar to those of thehawk moth(Manduca sexta), but flaps them in a non-traditional \"opposed x-wing fashion\" while \"blowing\" the surface to enhance lift based on theCoandă effectas well as to control vehicle attitude and direction. Waste gas from the propulsion system not only facilitates the blown wing aerodynamics, but also serves to create ultrasonic emissions like that of aBatfor obstacle avoidance. The Entomopter and other biologically-inspired robots leverage features of biological systems, but do not attempt to create mechanical analogs. Severalsnakerobots have been successfully developed. Mimicking the way real snakes move, these robots can navigate very confined spaces, meaning they may one day be used to search for people trapped in collapsed buildings.[100]The Japanese ACM-R5 snake robot[101]can even navigate both on land and in water.[102] A small number ofskatingrobots have been developed, one of which is a multi-mode walking and skating device. It has four legs, with unpowered wheels, which can either step or roll.[103]Another robot, Plen, can use a miniature skateboard or roller-skates, and skate across a desktop.[104] Several different approaches have been used to develop robots that have the ability to climb vertical surfaces. One approach mimics the movements of a humanclimberon a wall with protrusions; adjusting thecenter of massand moving each limb in turn to gain leverage. An example of this is Capuchin,[105]built by Ruixiang Zhang at Stanford University, California. Another approach uses the specialized toe pad method of wall-climbinggeckoes, which can run on smooth surfaces such as vertical glass. Examples of this approach include Wallbot[106]and Stickybot.[107] China'sTechnology Dailyreported on 15 November 2008, that Li Hiu Yeung and his research group of New Concept Aircraft (Zhuhai) Co., Ltd. had successfully developed a bionic gecko robot named \"Speedy Freelander\". According to Yeung, the gecko robot could rapidly climb up and down a variety of building walls, navigate through ground and wall fissures, and walk upside-down on the ceiling. It was also able to adapt to the surfaces of smooth glass, rough, sticky or dusty walls as well as various types of metallic materials. It could also identify and circumvent obstacles automatically. Its flexibility and speed were comparable to a natural gecko. A third approach is to mimic the motion of a snake climbing a pole.[41] It is calculated that whenswimmingsome fish can achieve apropulsiveefficiency greater than 90%.[108]Furthermore, they can accelerate and maneuver far better than any man-madeboatorsubmarine, and produce less noise and water disturbance. Therefore, many researchers studying underwater robots would like to copy this type of locomotion.[109]Notable examples are the Robotic Fish G9,[110]and Robot Tuna built to analyze and mathematically modelthunniform motion.[111]The Aqua Penguin,[112]copies the streamlined shape and propulsion by front \"flippers\" ofpenguins. The Aqua Ray and Aqua Jelly emulate the locomotion of manta ray, and jellyfish, respectively. In 2014,iSplash-II was developed as the firstrobotic fishcapable of outperforming real carangiform fish in terms of average maximum velocity (measured in body lengths/ second) and endurance, the duration that top speed is maintained.[113]This build attained swimming speeds of 11.6BL/s (i.e. 3.7 m/s).[114]The first build,iSplash-I (2014) was the first robotic platform to apply a full-body lengthcarangiformswimming motion which was found to increase swimming speed by 27% over the traditional approach of a posterior confined waveform.[115] Sailboat robots have also been developed in order to make measurements at the surface of the ocean. A typical sailboat robot isVaimos.[116]Since the propulsion of sailboat robots uses the wind, the energy of the batteries is only used for the computer, for the communication and for the actuators (to tune the rudder and the sail). If the robot is equipped with solar panels, the robot could theoretically navigate forever. The two main competitions of sailboat robots areWRSC, which takes place every year in Europe, andSailbot. Control systems may also have varying levels of autonomy. Direct interaction is used forhapticor teleoperated devices, and the human has nearly complete control over the robot's motion. Operator-assist modes have the operator commanding medium-to-high-level tasks, with the robot automatically figuring out how to achieve them.[118] An autonomous robot may go without human interaction for extended periods of time . Higher levels of autonomy do not necessarily require more complex cognitive capabilities. For example, robots in assembly plants are completely autonomous but operate in a fixed pattern. Another classification takes into account the interaction between human control and the machine motions. Teleoperation. A human controls each movement, each machine actuator change is specified by the operator. Supervisory. A human specifies general moves or position changes and the machine decides specific movements of its actuators. Task-level autonomy. The operator specifies only the task and the robot manages itself to complete it. Full autonomy. The machine will create and complete all its tasks without human interaction. Computer visionis the science and technology of machines that see. As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences and views from cameras. In most practical computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common. Computer vision systems rely on image sensors that detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of eithervisible lightorinfra-red light. The sensors are designed usingsolid-state physics. The process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained usingoptics. Sophisticated image sensors even requirequantum mechanicsto provide a complete understanding of the image formation process. Robots can also be equipped with multiple vision sensors to be better able to compute the sense of depth in the environment. Like human eyes, robots' \"eyes\" must also be able to focus on a particular area of interest, and also adjust to variations in light intensities. There is a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior ofbiological system, at different levels of complexity. Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision have a background in biology. Though a significant percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment, there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment. These robots require some combination ofnavigation hardware and softwarein order to traverse their environment. In particular, unforeseen events (e.g. people and other obstacles that are not stationary) can cause problems or collisions. Some highly advanced robots such asASIMOandMeinü robothave particularly good robot navigation hardware and software. Also,self-controlled cars,Ernst Dickmanns'driverless car, and the entries in theDARPA Grand Challenge, are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information, including by a swarm of autonomous robots.[119]Most of these robots employ aGPSnavigation device with waypoints, along withradar, sometimes combined with other sensory data such aslidar,video cameras, andinertial guidance systemsfor better navigation between waypoints. The state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors. If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance. The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans throughspeech,gestures, andfacial expressions, rather than acommand-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably be a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictionalC-3PO, orData of Star Trek, Next Generation. Even though the current state of robotics cannot meet the standards of these robots from science-fiction, robotic media characters (e.g., Wall-E, R2-D2) can elicit audience sympathies that increase people's willingness to accept actual robots in the future.[120]Acceptance of social robots is also likely to increase if people can meet a social robot under appropriate conditions. Studies have shown that interacting with a robot by looking at, touching, or even imagining interacting with the robot can reduce negative feelings that some people have about robots before interacting with them.[121]However, if pre-existing negative sentiments are especially strong, interacting with a robot can increase those negative feelings towards robots.[121] Interpreting the continuous flow ofsoundscoming from a human, inreal time, is a difficult task for a computer, mostly because of the great variability ofspeech.[122]The same word, spoken by the same person may sound different depending on localacoustics,volume, the previous word, whether or not the speaker has acold, etc.. It becomes even harder when the speaker has a differentaccent.[123]Nevertheless, great strides have been made in the field since Davis, Biddulph, and Balashek designed the first \"voice input system\" which recognized \"ten digits spoken by a single user with 100% accuracy\" in 1952.[124]Currently, the best systems can recognize continuous, natural speech, up to 160 words per minute, with an accuracy of 95%.[125]With the help of artificial intelligence, machines nowadays can use people's voice toidentify their emotionssuch as satisfied or angry.[126] Other hurdles exist when allowing the robot to use voice for interacting with humans. For social reasons,synthetic voiceproves suboptimal as a communication medium,[127]making it necessary to develop the emotional component of robotic voice through various techniques.[128][129]An advantage of diphonic branching is the emotion that the robot is programmed to project, can be carried on the voice tape, or phoneme, already pre-programmed onto the voice media. One of the earliest examples is a teaching robot named Leachim developed in 1974 byMichael J. Freeman.[130][131]Leachim was able to convert digital memory to rudimentary verbal speech on pre-recorded computer discs.[132]It was programmed to teach students inThe Bronx, New York.[132] Facial expressions can provide rapid feedback on the progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may be able to do the same for humans and robots. Robotic faces have been constructed byHanson Roboticsusing their elastic polymer calledFrubber, allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors (servos).[133]The coating and servos are built on a metalskull. A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression andbody language. Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot. Likewise, robots likeKismetand the more recent addition, Nexi[134]can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.[135] One can imagine, in the future, explaining to a robot chef how to make a pastry, or asking directions from a robot police officer. In both of these cases, making handgestureswould aid the verbal descriptions. In the first case, the robot would be recognizing gestures made by the human, and perhaps repeating them for confirmation. In the second case, the robot police officer would gesture to indicate \"down the road, then turn right\". It is likely that gestures will make up a part of the interaction between humans and robots.[136]A great many systems have been developed to recognize human hand gestures.[137] Proxemicsis the study of personal space, and HRI systems may try to model and work with its concepts for human interactions. Artificial emotionscan also be generated, composed of a sequence of facial expressions or gestures. As can be seen from the movieFinal Fantasy: The Spirits Within, the programming of these artificial emotions is complex and requires a large amount of human observation. To simplify this programming in the movie, presets were created together with a special software program. This decreased the amount of time needed to make the film. These presets could possibly be transferred for use in real-life robots. An example of a robot with artificial emotions is Robin the Robot developed by anArmenianIT company Expper Technologies, which uses AI-based peer-to-peer interaction. Its main task is achieving emotional well-being, i.e. overcome stress and anxiety. Robin was trained to analyze facial expressions and use his face to display his emotions given the context. The robot has been tested by kids in US clinics, and observations show that Robin increased the appetite and cheerfulness of children after meeting and talking.[138] Many of the robots of science fiction have apersonality, something which may or may not be desirable in the commercial robots of the future.[139]Nevertheless, researchers are trying to create robots which appear to have a personality:[140][141]i.e. they use sounds, facial expressions, and body language to try to convey an internal state, which may be joy, sadness, or fear. One commercial example isPleo, a toy robot dinosaur, which can exhibit several apparent emotions.[142] Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into newtypes of robots, alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them. Other investigations, such as MIT'scyberfloraproject, are almost wholly academic. To describe the level of advancement of a robot, the term \"Generation Robots\" can be used. This term is coined by ProfessorHans Moravec, Principal Research Scientist at theCarnegie Mellon UniversityRobotics Institutein describing the near future evolution of robot technology.First-generationrobots, Moravec predicted in 1997, should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps alizardand should become available by 2010. Because thefirst generationrobot would be incapable oflearning, however, Moravec predicts that thesecond generationrobot would be an improvement over thefirstand become available by 2020, with the intelligence maybe comparable to that of amouse. Thethird generationrobot should have intelligence comparable to that of amonkey. Thoughfourth generationrobots, robots withhumanintelligence, professor Moravec predicts, would become possible, he does not predict this happening before around 2040 or 2050.[143] The study of motion can be divided intokinematicsanddynamics.[144]Direct kinematics or forward kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation,velocity, andaccelerationwhen the corresponding joint values are known.Inverse kinematicsrefers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement),collisionavoidance, andsingularityavoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated usingkinematics, methods from the field ofdynamicsare used to study the effect offorcesupon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used incomputer simulationsof the robot.Inverse dynamicsrefers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end-effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot. In each area mentioned above, researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies, improve existing ones, and improve the interaction between these areas. To do this, criteria for \"optimal\" performance and ways to optimize design, structure, and control of robots must be developed and implemented. Open source roboticsresearch seeks standards for defining, and methods for designing and building, robots so that they can easily be reproduced by anyone. Research includes legal and technical definitions; seeking out alternative tools and materials to reduce costs and simplify builds; and creating interfaces and standards for designs to work together. Human usability research also investigates how to best document builds through visual, text or video instructions. Evolutionary robotsis amethodologythat usesevolutionary computationto help design robots, especially the body form, or motion and behaviorcontrollers. In a similar way tonatural evolution, a large population of robots is allowed to compete in some way, or their ability to perform a task is measured using afitness function. Those that perform worst are removed from the population and replaced by a new set, which have new behaviors based on those of the winners. Over time the population improves, and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear. This happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers. Researchers use this method both to create better robots,[145]and to explore the nature of evolution.[146]Because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated,[147]this technique may be run entirely or mostly insimulation, using arobot simulatorsoftware package, then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough.[148]Currently, there are about 10 million industrial robots toiling around the world, and Japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industry.[citation needed] Bionicsandbiomimeticsapply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots. For example, the design ofBionicKangaroowas based on the way kangaroos jump. Swarm roboticsis an approach to the coordination of multiple robots as a system which consist of large numbers of mostly simple physical robots. ″In a robot swarm, the collective behavior of the robots results from local interactions between the robots and between the robots and the environment in which they act.″*[119] There has been some research into whether robotics algorithms can be run more quickly onquantum computersthan they can be run ondigital computers. This area has been referred to as quantum robotics.[149] Nanorobots. Cobots(collaborative robots).[150] Autonomous drones. High temperature crucibles allow robotic systems to automate sample analysis.[151] The main venues for robotics research are the international conferences ICRA and IROS. Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics.[152]Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, particularly in parts of the USA,[153]as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence, and robotics among students. Robotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing environments. As factories increase their use of robots, the number of robotics–related jobs grow and have been observed to be steadily rising.[154]The employment of robots in industries has increased productivity and efficiency savings and is typically seen as a long-term investment for benefactors. A study found that 47 percent of US jobs are at risk to automation \"over some unspecified number of years\".[155]These claims have been criticized on the ground that social policy, not AI, causes unemployment.[156]In a 2016 article in The Guardian, Stephen Hawking stated \"The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining\".[157]The rise of robotics is thus often used as an argument foruniversal basic income. According to a GlobalData September 2021 report, the robotics industry was worth $45bn in 2020, and by 2030, it will have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% to $568bn, driving jobs in robotics and related industries.[158] A discussion paper drawn up byEU-OSHAhighlights how the spread of robotics presents both opportunities and challenges for occupational safety and health (OSH).[159] The greatest OSH benefits stemming from the wider use of robotics should be substitution for people working in unhealthy or dangerous environments. In space, defense, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance, and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers' exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, ergonomic and psychosocial risks. For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres. In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services.[160] Moreover, there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills. The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility, and adaptability. This need to combine optimal skills has resulted incollaborative robotsand humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the \"man-robot merger\". Some European countries are including robotics in their national programs and trying to promote a safe and flexible cooperation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity. For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) organises annual workshops on the topic \"human-robot collaboration\". In the future, cooperation between robots and humans will be diversified, with robots increasing their autonomy and human-robot collaboration reaching completely new forms. Current approaches and technical standards[161][162]aiming to protect employees from the risk of working with collaborative robots will have to be revised. Great user experience predicts the needs, experiences, behaviors, language and cognitive abilities, and other factors of each user group. It then uses these insights to produce a product or solution that is ultimately useful and usable. For robots, user experience begins with an understanding of the robot's intended task and environment, while considering any possible social impact the robot may have on human operations and interactions with it.[163] It defines that communication as the transmission of information through signals, which are elements perceived through touch, sound, smell and sight.[164]The author states that the signal connects the sender to the receiver and consists of three parts: the signal itself, what it refers to, and the interpreter. Body postures and gestures, facial expressions, hand and head movements are all part of nonverbal behavior and communication. Robots are no exception when it comes to human-robot interaction. Therefore, humans use their verbal and nonverbal behaviors to communicate their defining characteristics. Similarly, social robots need this coordination to perform human-like behaviors. Robotics is an interdisciplinary field, combining primarilymechanical engineeringandcomputer sciencebut also drawing onelectronic engineeringand other subjects. The usual way to build a career in robotics is to complete an undergraduate degree in one of these established subjects, followed by a graduate (masters') degree in Robotics. Graduate degrees are typically joined by students coming from all of the contributing disciplines, and include familiarization of relevant undergraduate level subject matter from each of them, followed by specialist study in pure robotics topics which build upon them. As an interdisciplinary subject, robotics graduate programmes tend to be especially reliant on students working and learning together and sharing their knowledge and skills from their home discipline first degrees. Robotics industry careers then follow the same pattern, with most roboticists working as part of interdisciplinary teams of specialists from these home disciplines followed by the robotics graduate degrees which enable them to work together. Workers typically continue to identify as members of their home disciplines who work in robotics, rather than as 'roboticists'. This structure is reinforced by the nature of some engineering professions, which grant chartered engineer status to members of home disciplines rather than to robotics as a whole. Robotics careers are widely predicted to grow in the 21st century, as robots replace more manual and intellectual human work. Some workers who lose their jobs to robotics may be well-placed to retrain to build and maintain these robots, using their domain-specific knowledge and skills.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "text": " Arobotis amachine—especially oneprogrammableby acomputer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically.[2]A robot can be guided by an external control device, or thecontrolmay be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to evokehuman form, but most robots are task-performing machines, designed with an emphasis on stark functionality, rather than expressive aesthetics. Robots can beautonomousor semi-autonomous and range from humanoids such asHonda'sAdvanced Step in Innovative Mobility(ASIMO) andTOSY'sTOSY Ping Pong Playing Robot(TOPIO) toindustrial robots,medical operating robots, patient assist robots, dog therapy robots, collectively programmedswarmrobots,UAV dronessuch asGeneral Atomics MQ-1 Predator, and even microscopicnano robots. By mimicking a lifelike appearance or automating movements, a robot may convey a sense of intelligence orthoughtof its own.Autonomous thingsare expected to proliferate in the future, with home robotics and theautonomous caras some of the main drivers.[3] The branch of technology that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots,[4]as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, andinformation processingisrobotics. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments ormanufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, or cognition. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field ofbio-inspired robotics. These robots have also created a newer branch of robotics:soft robotics. From the time ofancient civilization, there have been many accounts of user-configurable automated devices and evenautomataresembling humans and other animals, such asanimatronics, designed primarily as entertainment. As mechanical techniques developed through theIndustrial age, there appeared more practical applications such as automated machines, remote-control and wirelessremote-control. The term comes from a Slavic root,robot-, with meanings associated with labor. The word \"robot\" was first used to denote a fictional humanoid in a 1920Czech-languageplayR.U.R.(Rossumovi Univerzální Roboti–Rossum's Universal Robots) byKarel Čapek, though it was Karel's brotherJosef Čapekwho was the word's true inventor.[5][6][7]Electronics evolved into the driving force of development with the advent of the first electronic autonomous robots created byWilliam Grey Walterin Bristol, England in 1948, as well asComputer Numerical Control(CNC) machine tools in the late 1940s byJohn T. ParsonsandFrank L. Stulen. The first commercial, digital andprogrammablerobot was built byGeorge Devolin 1954 and was named theUnimate. It was sold toGeneral Motorsin 1961 where it was used to lift pieces of hot metal fromdie castingmachines at theInland Fisher Guide Plantin theWest Trentonsection ofEwing Township, New Jersey.[8] Robots have replaced humans[9]in performing repetitive and dangerous tasks which humans prefer not to do, or are unable to do because of size limitations, or which take place in extreme environments such as outer space or the bottom of the sea. There are concerns about the increasing use of robots and their role in society. Robots are blamed for risingtechnological unemploymentas they replace workers in increasing numbers of functions.[10]The use of robots in military combat raises ethical concerns. The possibilities of robot autonomy and potential repercussions have been addressed in fiction and may be a realistic concern in the future. The wordrobotcan refer to both physical robots andvirtualsoftware agents, but the latter are usually referred to asbots.[11]There is no consensus on which machines qualify as robots but there is general agreement among experts, and the public, that robots tend to possess some or all of the following abilities and functions: accept electronic programming, process data orphysical perceptionselectronically, operate autonomously to some degree, move around, operate physical parts of itself or physical processes, sense and manipulate their environment, and exhibit intelligent behavior, especially behavior which mimics humans or other animals.[12][13]Related to the concept of arobotis the field ofsynthetic biology, which studies entities whose nature is more comparable toliving thingsthan to machines. The idea of automata originates in the mythologies of many cultures around the world. Engineers and inventors from ancient civilizations, includingAncient China,[14]Ancient Greece, andPtolemaic Egypt,[15]attempted to build self-operating machines, some resembling animals and humans. Early descriptions of automata include the artificial doves ofArchytas,[16]the artificial birds ofMoziandLu Ban,[17]a \"speaking\" automaton byHero of Alexandria, a washstand automaton byPhilo of Byzantium, and a human automaton described in theLie Zi.[14] Many ancient mythologies, and most modern religions include artificial people, such as the mechanical servants built by the Greek godHephaestus[18](Vulcanto the Romans), the claygolemsof Jewish legend and clay giants of Norse legend, andGalatea, the mythical statue ofPygmalionthat came to life. Since circa 400 BC, myths ofCreteincludeTalos, a man of bronze who guarded the island from pirates. In ancient Greece, the Greek engineerCtesibius(c. 270 BC) \"applied a knowledge of pneumatics and hydraulics to produce the first organ and water clocks with moving figures.\"[19]: 2[20]In the 4th century BC, theGreekmathematicianArchytasof Tarentum postulated a mechanical steam-operated bird he called \"The Pigeon\".Hero of Alexandria(10–70 AD), a Greek mathematician and inventor, created numerous user-configurable automated devices, and described machines powered by air pressure, steam and water.[21] The 11th century Lokapannatti tells of how the Buddha's relics were protected by mechanical robots (bhuta vahana yanta), from the kingdom of Roma visaya (Rome); until they were disarmed by KingAshoka.[22] In ancient China, the 3rd-century text of theLie Zidescribes an account of humanoid automata, involving a much earlier encounter between Chinese emperorKing Mu of Zhouand a mechanical engineer known as Yan Shi, an 'artificer'. Yan Shi proudly presented the king with a life-size, human-shaped figure of his mechanical 'handiwork' made of leather, wood, and artificial organs.[14]There are also accounts of flying automata in theHan Fei Ziand other texts, which attributes the 5th century BCMohistphilosopherMoziand his contemporaryLu Banwith the invention of artificial wooden birds (ma yuan) that could successfully fly.[17] In 1066, the Chinese inventorSu Songbuilt awater clockin the form of a tower which featured mechanical figurines which chimed the hours.[23][24][25]His mechanism had a programmable drum machine with pegs (cams) that bumped into littleleversthat operated percussion instruments. The drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns by moving the pegs to different locations.[25] Samarangana Sutradhara, aSanskrittreatise byBhoja(11th century), includes a chapter about the construction of mechanical contrivances (automata), including mechanical bees and birds, fountains shaped like humans and animals, and male and female dolls that refilled oil lamps, danced, played instruments, and re-enacted scenes from Hindu mythology.[26][27][28] 13th centuryMuslim scientistIsmail al-Jazaricreated several automated devices. He built automated moving peacocks driven by hydropower.[29]He also invented the earliest known automatic gates, which were driven by hydropower,[30]created automatic doors as part of one of his elaboratewater clocks.[31]One of al-Jazari'shumanoid automatawas a waitress that could serve water, tea or drinks. The drink was stored in a tank with a reservoir from where the drink drips into a bucket and, after seven minutes, into a cup, after which the waitress appears out of an automatic door serving the drink.[32]Al-Jazari invented a hand washingautomatonincorporating a flush mechanism now used in modernflush toilets. It features a femalehumanoid automatonstanding by a basin filled with water. When the user pulls the lever, the water drains and the female automaton refills the basin.[19] Mark E. Rosheim summarizes the advances inroboticsmade by Muslim engineers, especially al-Jazari, as follows: Unlike the Greek designs, these Arab examples reveal an interest, not only in dramatic illusion, but in manipulating the environment for human comfort. Thus, the greatest contribution the Arabs made, besides preserving, disseminating and building on the work of the Greeks, was the concept of practical application. This was the key element that was missing in Greek robotic science.[19]: 9 In the 14th century, the coronation ofRichard II of Englandfeatured an automata angel.[34] InRenaissanceItaly,Leonardo da Vinci(1452–1519) sketched plans for a humanoid robot around 1495. Da Vinci's notebooks, rediscovered in the 1950s, contained detailed drawings of a mechanical knight now known asLeonardo's robot, able to sit up, wave its arms and move its head and jaw.[35]The design was probably based on anatomical research recorded in hisVitruvian Man. It is not known whether he attempted to build it. According toEncyclopædia Britannica,Leonardo da Vincimay have been influenced by the classic automata of al-Jazari.[29] In Japan, complex animal and human automata were built between the 17th to 19th centuries, with many described in the 18th centuryKarakuri zui(Illustrated Machinery, 1796). One such automaton was thekarakuri ningyō, a mechanizedpuppet.[36]Different variations of the karakuri existed: theButai karakuri, which were used in theatre, theZashiki karakuri, which were small and used in homes, and theDashi karakuriwhich were used in religious festivals, where the puppets were used to perform reenactments of traditionalmythsandlegends. In France, between 1738 and 1739,Jacques de Vaucansonexhibited several life-sized automatons: a flute player, a pipe player and a duck. The mechanical duck could flap its wings, crane its neck, and swallow food from the exhibitor's hand, and it gave the illusion of digesting its food by excreting matter stored in a hidden compartment.[37]About 30 years later in Switzerland the clockmakerPierre Jaquet-Drozmade several complex mechanical figures that could write and play music. Several of these devices still exist and work.[38] Remotely operated vehicles were demonstrated in the late 19th century in the form of several types of remotely controlledtorpedoes. The early 1870s saw remotely controlledtorpedoesbyJohn Ericsson(pneumatic),John Louis Lay(electric wire guided), andVictor von Scheliha(electric wire guided).[39] TheBrennan torpedo, invented byLouis Brennanin 1877, was powered by two contra-rotating propellers that were spun by rapidly pulling out wires from drums wound inside thetorpedo. Differential speed on the wires connected to the shore station allowed the torpedo to be guided to its target, making it \"the world's firstpracticalguided missile\".[40]In 1897 the British inventor Ernest Wilson was granted a patent for a torpedo remotely controlled by \"Hertzian\" (radio) waves[41][42]and in 1898Nikola Teslapublicly demonstrated a wireless-controlledtorpedothat he hoped to sell to theUS Navy.[43][44] In 1903, the Spanish engineerLeonardo Torres Quevedodemonstrated a radio control system calledTelekinoat theParis Academy of Sciences,[45]which he wanted to use to control anairshipof his own design. He obtained several patents for the system in other countries.[46][47]Unlike previous 'on/off' techniques, Torres established a method for controlling any mechanical or electrical device with different states of operation.[48]TheTelekinoremotely controlled atricyclein 1904, considered the first case of anunmanned ground vehicle, and an electricboatwith a crew in 1906, which was controlled at a distance over 2 km.[49] Archibald Low, known as the \"father of radio guidance systems\" for his pioneering work on guided rockets and planes during theFirst World War. In 1917, he demonstrated a remote controlled aircraft to theRoyal Flying Corpsand in the same year built the first wire-guided rocket. In 1928, one of the first humanoid robots,Eric, was exhibited at the annual exhibition of the Model Engineers Society in London, where it delivered a speech. Invented by W. H. Richards, the robot's frame consisted of an aluminiumbody of armourwith elevenelectromagnetsand one motor powered by a twelve-volt power source. The robot could move its hands and head and could be controlled through remote control or voice control.[50]Both Eric and his \"brother\" George toured the world.[51] Westinghouse Electric Corporationbuilt Televox in 1926; it was a cardboard cutout connected to various devices which users could turn on and off. In 1939, the humanoid robot known asElektrowas debuted at the1939 New York World's Fair.[52][53]Seven feet tall (2.1 m) and weighing 265 pounds (120.2 kg), it could walk by voice command, speak about 700 words (using a 78-rpmrecord player), smoke cigarettes, blow up balloons, and move its head and arms. The body consisted of a steel gear, cam and motor skeleton covered by an aluminum skin. In 1928, Japan's first robot,Gakutensoku, was designed and constructed by biologist Makoto Nishimura. The GermanV-1 flying bombwas equipped with systems for automatic guidance and range control, flying on a predetermined course (which could include a 90-degree turn) and entering a terminal dive after a predetermined distance. It was reported as being a 'robot' in contemporary descriptions[54] The first electronic autonomous robots with complex behaviour were created byWilliam Grey Walterof theBurden Neurological InstituteatBristol, England in 1948 and 1949. He wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number ofbrain cellscould give rise to very complexbehaviors– essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. His first robots, namedElmerandElsie, were constructed between 1948 and 1949 and were often described astortoisesdue to their shape and slow rate of movement. The three-wheeled tortoise robots were capable ofphototaxis, by which they could find their way to a recharging station when they ran low on battery power. Walter stressed the importance of using purelyanalogueelectronics tosimulatebrain processes at a time when his contemporaries such asAlan TuringandJohn von Neumannwere all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms ofdigitalcomputation. His work inspired subsequent generations of robotics researchers such asRodney Brooks,Hans MoravecandMark Tilden. Modern incarnations of Walter'sturtlesmay be found in the form ofBEAM robotics.[55] The first digitally operated and programmable robot was invented byGeorge Devolin 1954 and was ultimately called theUnimate. This ultimately laid the foundations of the modern robotics industry.[56]Devol sold the first Unimate toGeneral Motorsin 1960, and it was installed in 1961 in a plant inTrenton, New Jerseyto lift hot pieces of metal from adie castingmachine and stack them.[57] The firstpalletizing robotwas introduced in 1963 by the Fuji Yusoki Kogyo Company.[58]In 1973, a robot with six electromechanically driven axes was patented[59][60][61]byKUKArobotics in Germany, and theprogrammable universal manipulation armwas invented byVictor Scheinmanin 1976, and the design was sold toUnimation. Commercial and industrial robots are now in widespread use performing jobs more cheaply or with greater accuracy and reliability than humans. They are also employed for jobs which are too dirty, dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans. Robots are widely used in manufacturing, assembly and packing, transport, earth and space exploration, surgery, weaponry, laboratory research, and mass production of consumer and industrial goods.[62] Various techniques have emerged to develop the science of robotics and robots. One method isevolutionary robotics, in which a number of differing robots are submitted to tests. Those which perform best are used as a model to create a subsequent \"generation\" of robots. Another method isdevelopmental robotics, which tracks changes and development within a single robot in the areas of problem-solving and other functions. Another new type of robot is just recently introduced which acts both as a smartphone and robot and is named RoboHon.[63] As robots become more advanced, eventually there may be a standard computeroperating systemdesigned mainly for robots.Robot Operating System(ROS) is anopen-source softwareset of programs being developed atStanford University, theMassachusetts Institute of Technology, and theTechnical University of Munich, Germany, among others. ROS provides ways to program arobot's navigationand limbs regardless of the specific hardware involved. It also provides high-level commands for items likeimage recognitionand even opening doors. When ROS boots up on a robot's computer, it would obtain data on attributes such as the length and movement of robots' limbs. It would relay this data to higher-level algorithms. Microsoft is also developing a \"Windows for robots\" system with its Robotics Developer Studio, which has been available since 2007.[64] Japan hopes to have full-scale commercialization of service robots by 2025. Much technological research in Japan is led by Japanese government agencies, particularly the Trade Ministry.[65] Many future applications of robotics seem obvious to people, even though they are well beyond the capabilities of robots available at the time of the prediction.[66][67]As early as 1982 people were confident that someday robots would:[68]1. Clean parts by removingmolding flash2. Spray paint automobiles with absolutely no human presence 3. Pack things in boxes—for example, orient and nest chocolate candies in candy boxes 4. Make electricalcable harness5. Load trucks with boxes—apacking problem6. Handle soft goods, such as garments and shoes 7. Shear sheep 8. Be used asprostheses9. Cook fast food and work in other service industries 10. Work as a household robot. Generally such predictions are overly optimistic in timescale. In 2008,Caterpillar Inc.developed a dump truck which can drive itself without any human operator.[69]Many analysts believe that self-driving trucks may eventually revolutionize logistics.[70]By 2014, Caterpillar had a self-driving dump truck which is expected to greatly change the process of mining. In 2015, these Caterpillar trucks were actively used in mining operations in Australia by the mining companyRio Tinto Coal Australia.[71][72][73][74]Some analysts believe that within the next few decades, most trucks will be self-driving.[75] A literate or 'reading robot' named Marge has intelligence that comes from software. She can read newspapers, find and correct misspelled words, learn about banks like Barclays, and understand that some restaurants are better places to eat than others.[76] Baxteris a new robot introduced in 2012 which learns by guidance. A worker could teach Baxter how to perform a task by moving its hands in the desired motion and having Baxter memorize them. Extra dials, buttons, and controls are available on Baxter's arm for more precision and features. Any regular worker could program Baxter and it only takes a matter of minutes, unlike usual industrial robots that take extensive programs and coding to be used. This means Baxter needs no programming to operate. No software engineers are needed. This also means Baxter can be taught to perform multiple, more complicated tasks. Sawyer was added in 2015 for smaller, more precise tasks.[77] Prototype cooking robots have been developed and could be programmed for autonomous, dynamic and adjustable preparation of discrete meals.[78][79] The wordrobotwas introduced to the public by theCzechinterwarwriterKarel Čapekin his playR.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots), published in 1920.[6]The play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified people calledrobots.The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas ofandroids, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. At issue is whether the robots are beingexploitedand the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans). Karel Čapek himself did not coin the word. He wrote a short letter in reference to anetymologyin theOxford English Dictionaryin which he named his brother, the painter and writerJosef Čapek, as its actual originator.[6] In an article in the Czech journalLidové novinyin 1933, he explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatureslaboři('workers', fromLatinlabor). However, he did not like the word, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggestedroboti. The wordrobotameans literally'corvée, serf labor', and figuratively'drudgery, hard work'inCzechand also (more general)'work, labor'in manySlavic languages(e.g.:Bulgarian,Russian,Serbian,Slovak,Polish,Macedonian,Ukrainian, archaic Czech, as well asrobotinHungarian). Traditionally therobota(Hungarianrobot) was the work period a serf (corvée) had to give for his lord, typically six months of the year. The origin of the word is theOld Church Slavonicrabota'servitude'('work'in contemporary Bulgarian, Macedonian and Russian), which in turn comes from theProto-Indo-Europeanroot*orbh-.Robotiscognatewith the GermanArbeit'work'.[80][81] English pronunciation of the word has evolved relatively quickly since its introduction. In the U.S. during the late 1930s to early 1940s it was pronounced/ˈroʊboʊt/.[82][better source needed]By the late 1950s to early 1960s, some were pronouncing it/ˈroʊbət/, while others used/ˈroʊbɒt/[83]By the 1970s, its current pronunciation/ˈroʊbɒt/had become predominant. The wordrobotics, used to describe this field of study,[4]was coined by the science fiction writerIsaac Asimov. Asimov created theThree Laws of Roboticswhich are a recurring theme in his books. These have since been used by many others to define laws used in fiction. (The three laws are pure fiction, and no technology yet created has the ability to understand or follow them, and in fact most robots serve military purposes, which run quite contrary to the first law and often the third law. \"People think about Asimov's laws, but they were set up to point out how a simple ethical system doesn't work. If you read the short stories, every single one is about a failure, and they are totally impractical,\" said Dr. Joanna Bryson of the University of Bath.[84]) Mobile robots[85]have the capability to move around in their environment and are not fixed to one physical location. An example of a mobile robot that is in common use today is theautomated guided vehicleorautomatic guided vehicle(AGV). An AGV is a mobile robot that follows markers or wires in the floor, or uses vision or lasers.[86]AGVs are discussed later in this article. Mobile robots are also found in industry, military and security environments.[87]They also appear as consumer products, for entertainment or to perform certain tasks like vacuum cleaning. Mobile robots are the focus of a great deal of current research and almost every major university has one or more labs that focus on mobile robot research.[88] Mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as onassembly linesbecause they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference. Because of this most humans rarely encounter robots. Howeverdomestic robotsfor cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries. Robots can also be found inmilitaryapplications.[89] Industrial robots usually consist of ajointed arm(multi-linked manipulator) and anend effectorthat is attached to a fixed surface. One of the most common type of end effector is agripperassembly. TheInternational Organization for Standardizationgives a definition of a  manipulating industrial robot inISO 8373: \"an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose, manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications.\"[90] This definition is used by theInternational Federation of Robotics, the European Robotics Research Network (EURON) and many national standards committees.[91] The industrial robots in food and drink processing plants are used for tasks such as feeding machines, packaging, and palletizing, which have replaced many manual, physical tasks. The complexity of digital skills required by workers varies depending on the level of automation and the specific tasks involved.[92] Most commonly industrial robots are fixed robotic arms and manipulators used primarily for production and distribution of goods. The term \"service robot\" is less well-defined. TheInternational Federation of Roboticshas proposed a tentative definition, \"A service robot is a robot which operates semi- or fully autonomously to perform services useful to the well-being of humans and equipment, excluding manufacturing operations.\"[93] Robots are used as educational assistants to teachers. From the 1980s, robots such asturtleswere used in schools and programmed using theLogolanguage.[94][95] There arerobot kitslikeLego Mindstorms,BIOLOID, OLLO from ROBOTIS, or BotBrain Educational Robots can help children to learn about mathematics, physics, programming, and electronics. Robotics have also been introduced into the lives of elementary and high school students in the form ofrobot competitionswith the companyFIRST(For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology). The organization is the foundation for theFIRST Robotics Competition,FIRST Tech Challenge,FIRST Lego League ChallengeandFIRST Lego League Explorecompetitions. There have also been robots such as the teaching computer, Leachim (1974).[96]Leachim was an early example of speech synthesis using theDiphone synthesismethod.2-XL(1976) was a robot shaped game / teaching toy based on branching between audible tracks on an8-track tapeplayer, both invented byMichael J. Freeman.[97]Later, the 8-track was upgraded to tape cassettes and then to digital. Modular robots are a new breed of robots that are designed to increase the use of robots by modularizing their architecture.[98]The functionality and effectiveness of a modular robot is easier to increase compared to conventional robots. These robots are composed of a single type of identical, several different identical module types, or similarly shaped modules, which vary in size. Their architectural structure allows hyper-redundancy for modular robots, as they can be designed with more than 8 degrees of freedom (DOF). Creating the programming,inverse kinematicsand dynamics for modular robots is more complex than with traditional robots. Modular robots may be composed of L-shaped modules, cubic modules, and U and H-shaped modules. ANAT technology, an early modular robotic technology patented by Robotics Design Inc., allows the creation of modular robots from U- and H-shaped modules that connect in a chain, and are used to form heterogeneous and homogenous modular robot systems. These \"ANAT robots\" can be designed with \"n\" DOF as each module is a complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively to the modules connected before and after it in its chain, and therefore a single module allows one degree of freedom. The more modules that are connected to one another, the more degrees of freedom it will have. L-shaped modules can also be designed in a chain, and must become increasingly smaller as the size of the chain increases, as payloads attached to the end of the chain place a greater strain on modules that are further from the base. ANAT H-shaped modules do not suffer from this problem, as their design allows a modular robot to distribute pressure and impacts evenly amongst other attached modules, and therefore payload-carrying capacity does not decrease as the length of the arm increases. Modular robots can be manually or self-reconfigured to form a different robot, that may perform different applications. Because modular robots of the same architecture type are composed of modules that compose different modular robots, a snake-arm robot can combine with another to form a dual or quadra-arm robot, or can split into several mobile robots, and mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones, or combine with others into a larger or different one. This allows a single modular robot the ability to be fully specialized in a single task, as well as the capacity to be specialized to perform multiple different tasks. Modular robotic technology is currently being applied in hybrid transportation,[99]industrial automation,[100]duct cleaning[101]and handling. Many research centres and universities have also studied this technology, and have developed prototypes. Acollaborative robotorcobotis a robot that can safely and effectively interact with human workers while performing simple industrial tasks. However, end-effectors and other environmental conditions may create hazards, and as such risk assessments should be done before using any industrial motion-control application.[102] The collaborative robots most widely used in industries today are manufactured byUniversal Robotsin Denmark.[103] Rethink Robotics—founded byRodney Brooks, previously withiRobot—introducedBaxterin September 2012; as anindustrial robotdesigned to safely interact with neighboring human workers, and be programmable for performing simple tasks.[104]Baxters stop if they detect a human in the way of their robotic arms and have prominent off switches. Intended for sale to small businesses, they are promoted as the robotic analogue of the personal computer.[105]As of May 2014[update], 190 companies in the US have bought Baxters and they are being used commercially in the UK.[10] Roughly half of all the robots in the world are in Asia, 32% in Europe, and 16% in North America, 1% inAustralasiaand 1% in Africa.[108]40% of all the robots in the world are in Japan,[109]making Japan the country with the highest number of robots. As robots have become more advanced and sophisticated, experts and academics have increasingly explored the questions of what ethics might govern robots' behavior,[111][112]and whether robots might be able to claim any kind of social, cultural, ethical or legal rights.[113]One scientific team has said that it was possible that a robot brain would exist by 2019.[114]Others predict robot intelligence breakthroughs by 2050.[115]Recent advances have made robotic behavior more sophisticated.[116]The social impact of intelligent robots is subject of a 2010 documentary film calledPlug & Pray.[117] Vernor Vingehas suggested that a moment may come when computers and robots are smarter than humans. He calls this \"the Singularity\".[118]He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans.[119]This is discussed by a philosophy calledSingularitarianism. In 2009, experts attended a conference hosted by theAssociation for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence(AAAI) to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any autonomy, and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard. They noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \"cockroach intelligence.\" They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.[118]Various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy, and which pose some inherent concerns.[120][121][122] Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.[123]There are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots to be controlled mainly by other robots.[124]The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that, asmilitary robotsbecome more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.[125][126]One researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane, as they could make decisions more effectively. However, other experts question this.[127] One robot in particular, theEATR, has generated public concerns[128]over its fuel source, as it can continually refuel itself using organic substances.[129]Although the engine for the EATR is designed to run onbiomassand vegetation[130]specifically selected by its sensors, which it can find on battlefields or other local environments, the project has stated that chicken fat can also be used.[131] Manuel De Landahas noted that \"smart missiles\" and autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots, as they make some of their decisions autonomously. He believes this represents an important and dangerous trend in which humans are handing over important decisions to machines.[132] For centuries, people have predicted that machines would makeworkers obsolete and increase unemployment, although the causes of unemployment are usually thought to be due to social policy.[133][134][135] A recent example of human replacement involves Taiwanese technology companyFoxconnwho, in July 2011, announced a three-year plan to replace workers with more robots. At present the company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them to a million robots over a three-year period.[136] Lawyers have speculated that an increased prevalence of robots in the workplace could lead to the need to improve redundancy laws.[137] Kevin J. Delaney said \"Robots are taking human jobs. But Bill Gates believes that governments should tax companies' use of them, as a way to at least temporarily slow the spread of automation and to fund other types of employment.\"[138]Therobot taxwould also help pay a guaranteed living wage to the displaced workers. TheWorld Bank'sWorld Development Report2019 puts forth evidence showing that while automation displaces workers, technological innovation creates more new industries and jobs on balance.[139] At present, there are two main types of robots, based on their use:general-purpose autonomous robotsand dedicated robots. Robots can be classified by theirspecificityof purpose. A robot might be designed to perform one particular task extremely well, or a range of tasks less well. All robots by their nature can be re-programmed to behave differently, but some are limited by their physical form. For example, a factory robot arm can perform jobs such as cutting, welding, gluing, or acting as a fairground ride, while a pick-and-place robot can only populate printed circuit boards. General-purpose autonomous robots can perform a variety of functions independently. General-purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently in known spaces, handle their own re-charging needs, interface with electronic doors and elevators and perform other basic tasks. Like computers, general-purpose robots can link with networks, software and accessories that increase their usefulness. They may recognize people or objects, talk, provide companionship, monitor environmental quality, respond to alarms, pick up supplies and perform other useful tasks. General-purpose robots may perform a variety of functions simultaneously or they may take on different roles at different times of day. Some such robots try to mimic human beings and may even resemble people in appearance; this type of robot is called a humanoid robot. Humanoid robots are still in a very limited stage, as no humanoid robot can, as of yet, actually navigate around a room that it has never been in.[140]Thus, humanoid robots are really quite limited, despite their intelligent behaviors in their well-known environments. Over the last three decades,automobile factorieshave become dominated by robots. A typical factory contains hundreds ofindustrial robotsworking on fully automated production lines, with one robot for every ten human workers. On an automated production line, a vehicle chassis on a conveyor iswelded,glued, painted and finally assembled at a sequence of robot stations. Industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing and packaging of manufactured goods, for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from the end of a conveyor belt and placing them into boxes, or for loading and unloading machining centers. Mass-producedprinted circuit boards(PCBs) are almost exclusively manufactured by pick-and-place robots, typically withSCARAmanipulators, which remove tinyelectronic componentsfrom strips or trays, and place them on to PCBs with great accuracy.[141]Such robots can place hundreds of thousands of components per hour, far out-performing a human in speed, accuracy, and reliability.[142] Mobile robots, following markers or wires in the floor, or using vision[86]or lasers, are used to transport goods around large facilities, such as warehouses, container ports, or hospitals.[143] Limited to tasks that could be accurately defined and had to be performed the same way every time. Very little feedback or intelligence was required, and the robots needed only the most basicexteroceptors(sensors). The limitations of these AGVs are that their paths are not easily altered and they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them. If one AGV breaks down, it may stop the entire operation. Developed to deploy triangulation from beacons or bar code grids for scanning on the floor or ceiling. In most factories, triangulation systems tend to require moderate to high maintenance, such as daily cleaning of all beacons or bar codes. Also, if a tall pallet or large vehicle blocks beacons or a bar code is marred, AGVs may become lost. Often such AGVs are designed to be used in human-free environments. Such as SmartLoader,[144]SpeciMinder,[145]ADAM,[146]Tug[147]Eskorta,[148]and MT 400 with Motivity[149]are designed for people-friendly workspaces. They navigate by recognizing natural features.3D scannersor other means of sensing the environment in two or three dimensions help to eliminate cumulativeerrorsindead-reckoningcalculations of the AGV's current position. Some AGVs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers withsimultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM) and use those maps to navigate in real time with otherpath planningand obstacle avoidance algorithms. They are able to operate in complex environments and perform non-repetitive and non-sequential tasks such as transportingphotomasksin a semiconductor lab, specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses. For dynamic areas, such as warehouses full of pallets, AGVs require additional strategies using three-dimensional sensors such astime-of-flightorstereovisioncameras. There are many jobs that humans would rather leave to robots. The job may be boring, such asdomestic cleaningorsports field line marking, or dangerous, such as exploring inside avolcano.[150]Other jobs are physically inaccessible, such as exploring anotherplanet,[151]cleaning the inside of a long pipe, or performinglaparoscopicsurgery.[152] Almost every unmannedspace probeever launched was a robot.[153][154]Some were launched in the 1960s with very limited abilities, but their ability to fly and land (in the case ofLuna 9) is an indication of their status as a robot. This includes theVoyager probesand the Galileo probes, among others. Teleoperated robots, or telerobots, are devicesremotely operatedfrom a distance by a human operator rather than following a predetermined sequence of movements, but which has semi-autonomous behaviour. They are used when a human cannot be present on site to perform a job because it is dangerous, far away, or inaccessible. The robot may be in another room or another country, or may be on a very different scale to the operator. For instance, a laparoscopic surgery robot allows the surgeon to work inside a human patient on a relatively small scale compared to open surgery, significantly shortening recovery time.[152]They can also be used to avoid exposing workers to the hazardous and tight spaces such as inductcleaning. When disabling a bomb, the operator sends a small robot to disable it. Several authors have been using a device called the Longpen to sign books remotely.[155]Teleoperated robot aircraft, like the PredatorUnmanned Aerial Vehicle, are increasingly being used by the military. These pilotless drones can search terrain and fire on targets.[156][157]Hundreds of robots such asiRobot'sPackbotand theFoster-Miller TALONare being used inIraqandAfghanistanby theU.S. militaryto defuse roadside bombs orimprovised explosive devices(IEDs) in an activity known asexplosive ordnance disposal(EOD).[158] Robots are used toautomate picking fruiton orchards at a cost lower than that of human pickers. Domestic robotsare simple robots dedicated to a single task work in home use. They are used in simple but often disliked jobs, such asvacuum cleaning,floor washing, andlawn mowing. An example of a domestic robot is aRoomba. Military robots include theSWORDS robotwhich is currently used in ground-based combat. It can use a variety of weapons and there is some discussion of giving it some degree of autonomy in battleground situations.[159][160][161] Unmanned combat air vehicles(UCAVs), which are an upgraded form ofUAVs, can do a wide variety of missions, including combat. UCAVs are being designed such as theBAE Systems Mantiswhich would have the ability to fly themselves, to pick their own course and target, and to make most decisions on their own.[162]TheBAE Taranisis a UCAV built by Great Britain which can fly across continents without a pilot and has new means to avoid detection.[163]Flight trials are expected to begin in 2011.[164] TheAAAIhas studied this topic in depth[111]and its president has commissioned a study to look at this issue.[165] Some have suggested a need to build \"Friendly AI\", meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.[166]Several such measures reportedly already exist, with robot-heavy countries such as Japan and South Korea[167]having begun to pass regulations requiring robots to be equipped with safety systems, and possibly sets of 'laws' akin to Asimov'sThree Laws of Robotics.[168][169]An official report was issued in 2009 by the Japanese government's Robot Industry Policy Committee.[170]Chinese officials and researchers have issued a report suggesting a set of ethical rules, and a set of new legal guidelines referred to as \"Robot Legal Studies.\"[171]Some concern has been expressed over a possible occurrence of robots telling apparent falsehoods.[172] Mining robots are designed to solve a number of problems currently facing the mining industry, including skills shortages, improving productivity from declining ore grades, and achieving environmental targets. Due to the hazardous nature of mining, in particularunderground mining, the prevalence of autonomous, semi-autonomous, and tele-operated robots has greatly increased in recent times. A number of vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains, trucks andloadersthat will load material, transport it on the mine site to its destination, and unload without requiring human intervention. One of the world's largest mining corporations,Rio Tinto, has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet to the world's largest, consisting of 150 autonomousKomatsutrucks, operating inWestern Australia.[173]Similarly,BHPhas announced the expansion of its autonomous drill fleet to the world's largest, 21 autonomousAtlas Copcodrills.[174] Drilling,longwallandrockbreakingmachines are now also available as autonomous robots.[175]TheAtlas CopcoRig Control System can autonomously execute a drilling plan on adrilling rig, moving the rig into position using GPS, set up the drill rig and drill down to specified depths.[176]Similarly, theTransminRocklogic system can automatically plan a path to position a rockbreaker at a selected destination.[177]These systems greatly enhance the safety and efficiency of mining operations. Robots in healthcare have two main functions. Those which assist an individual, such as a sufferer of a disease like Multiple Sclerosis, and those which aid in the overall systems such as pharmacies and hospitals. Robots used inhome automationhave developed over time from simple basic robotic assistants, such as theHandy 1,[178]through to semi-autonomous robots, such asFRIENDwhich can assist the elderly and disabled with common tasks. The population isagingin many countries, especially Japan, meaning that there are increasing numbers of elderly people to care for, but relatively fewer young people to care for them.[179][180]Humans make the best carers, but where they are unavailable, robots are gradually being introduced.[181] FRIEND is a semi-autonomous robot designed to supportdisabledandelderlypeople in their daily life activities, like preparing and serving a meal. FRIEND make it possible forpatientswho areparaplegic, have muscle diseases or seriousparalysis(due to strokes etc.), to perform tasks without help from other people like therapists or nursing staff. Script Pro manufactures a robot designed to help pharmacies fill prescriptions that consist of oral solids ormedicationsin pill form.[182][better source needed]The pharmacist orpharmacy technicianenters the prescription information into its information system. The system, upon determining whether or not the drug is in the robot, will send the information to the robot for filling. The robot has 3 different size vials to fill determined by the size of the pill. The robot technician, user, or pharmacist determines the needed size of the vial based on the tablet when the robot is stocked. Once the vial is filled it is brought up to a conveyor belt that delivers it to a holder that spins the vial and attaches the patient label. Afterwards it is set on another conveyor that delivers the patient's medication vial to a slot labeled with the patient's name on an LED read out. The pharmacist or technician then checks the contents of the vial to ensure it's the correct drug for the correct patient and then seals the vials and sends it out front to be picked up. McKesson's Robot RX is another healthcare robotics product that helps pharmacies dispense thousands of medications daily with little or no errors.[183]The robot can be ten feet wide and thirty feet long and can hold hundreds of different kinds of medications and thousands of doses. The pharmacy saves many resources like staff members that are otherwise unavailable in a resource scarce industry. It uses anelectromechanicalhead coupled with apneumaticsystem to capture each dose and deliver it to either its stocked or dispensed location. The head moves along a single axis while it rotates 180 degrees to pull the medications. During this process it usesbarcodetechnology to verify it's pulling the correct drug. It then delivers the drug to a patient specific bin on a conveyor belt. Once the bin is filled with all of the drugs that a particular patient needs and that the robot stocks, the bin is then released and returned out on the conveyor belt to a technician waiting to load it into a cart for delivery to the floor. While most robots today are installed in factories or homes, performing labour or life saving jobs, many new types of robot are being developed inlaboratoriesaround the world. Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into new types of robot, alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them. It is expected that these new types of robot will be able to solve real world problems when they are finally realized.[citation needed] One approach to designing robots is to base them on animals.BionicKangaroowas designed and engineered by studying and applying the physiology and methods of locomotion of a kangaroo. Nanoroboticsis theemerging technologyfield of creating machines or robots whose components are at or close to the microscopic scale of ananometer(10−9meters). Also known as \"nanobots\" or \"nanites\", they would be constructed frommolecular machines. So far, researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems, such as bearings, sensors, andsynthetic molecular motors, but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the Nanobot Robocup contest.[184]Researchers also hope to be able to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria, which could perform tasks on a tiny scale. Possible applications include micro surgery (on the level of individualcells),utility fog,[185]manufacturing, weaponry and cleaning.[186]Some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce, the earth would turn into \"grey goo\", while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense.[187][188] A few researchers have investigated the possibility of creating robots which canalter their physical formto suit a particular task,[189]like the fictionalT-1000. Real robots are nowhere near that sophisticated however, and mostly consist of a small number of cube shaped units, which can move relative to their neighbours. Algorithms have been designed in case any such robots become a reality.[190] In July 2020 scientists reported the development of a mobile robot chemist and demonstrate that it can assist in experimental searches. According to the scientists their strategy wasautomatingthe researcher rather than the instruments – freeing up time for the human researchers to think creatively – and could identify photocatalyst mixtures for hydrogen production from water that were six times more active than initial formulations. The modular robot can operate laboratory instruments, work nearly around the clock, and autonomously make decisions on his next actions depending on experimental results.[191][192] Robots withsiliconebodies and flexible actuators (air muscles,electroactive polymers, andferrofluids) look and feel different from robots with rigid skeletons, and can have different behaviors.[193]Soft, flexible (and sometimes even squishy) robots are often designed to mimic the biomechanics of animals and other things found in nature, which is leading to new applications in medicine, care giving, search and rescue, food handling and manufacturing, and scientific exploration.[194][195] Inspired bycolonies of insectssuch asantsandbees, researchers are modeling the behavior ofswarmsof thousands of tiny robots which together perform a useful task, such as finding something hidden, cleaning, or spying. Each robot is quite simple, but theemergent behaviorof the swarm is more complex. The whole set of robots can be considered as one single distributed system, in the same way an ant colony can be considered asuperorganism, exhibitingswarm intelligence. The largest swarms so far created include the iRobot swarm, the SRI/MobileRobots CentiBots project[196]and the Open-source Micro-robotic Project swarm, which are being used to research collective behaviors.[197][198]Swarms are also more resistant to failure. Whereas one large robot may fail and ruin a mission, a swarm can continue even if several robots fail. This could make them attractive for space exploration missions, where failure is normally extremely costly.[199] Robotics also has application in the design ofvirtual realityinterfaces. Specialized robots are in widespread use in thehapticresearch community. These robots, called \"haptic interfaces\", allow touch-enabled user interaction with real and virtual environments. Robotic forces allow simulating the mechanical properties of \"virtual\" objects, which users can experience through their sense oftouch.[200] Robots are used by contemporary artists to create works that include mechanical automation. There are many branches of robotic art, one of which isrobotic installation art, a type ofinstallation artthat is programmed to respond to viewer interactions, by means of computers, sensors and actuators. The future behavior of such installations can therefore be altered by input from either the artist or the participant, which differentiates these artworks from other types ofkinetic art. Le Grand Palaisin Paris organized an exhibition \"Artists & Robots\", featuring artworks created by more than forty artists with the help of robots in 2018.[201] Robotic characters,androids(artificial men/women) orgynoids(artificial women), andcyborgs(also \"bionicmen/women\", or humans with significant mechanical enhancements) have become a staple of science fiction. The first reference in Western literature to mechanical servants appears inHomer'sIliad. In Book XVIII,Hephaestus, god of fire, creates new armor for the hero Achilles, assisted by robots.[202]According to theRieutranslation, \"Golden maidservants hastened to help their master. They looked like real women and could not only speak and use their limbs but were endowed with intelligence and trained in handwork by the immortal gods.\" The words \"robot\" or \"android\" are not used to describe them, but they are nevertheless mechanical devices human in appearance. \"The first use of the word Robot was in Karel Čapek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) (written in 1920)\". Writer Karel Čapek was born in Czechoslovakia (Czech Republic). Possibly the most prolific author of the twentieth century wasIsaac Asimov(1920–1992)[203]who published over five-hundred books.[204]Asimov is probably best remembered for his science-fiction stories and especially those about robots, where he placed robots and their interaction with society at the center of many of his works.[205][206]Asimov carefully considered the problem of the ideal set of instructions robots might be given to lower the risk to humans, and arrived at hisThree Laws of Robotics: a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; a robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.[207]These were introduced in his 1942 short story \"Runaround\", although foreshadowed in a few earlier stories. Later, Asimov added the Zeroth Law: \"A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm\"; the rest of the laws are modified sequentially to acknowledge this. According to theOxford English Dictionary,the first passage in Asimov's short story \"Liar!\" (1941) that mentions the First Law is the earliest recorded use of the wordrobotics. Asimov was not initially aware of this; he assumed the word already existed by analogy withmechanics,hydraulics,and other similar terms denoting branches of applied knowledge.[208] Robots are used in a number of competitive events.Robot combatcompetitions have been popularized by television shows such asRobot WarsandBattleBots, featuring mostly remotely controlled 'robots' that compete against each other directly using various weaponry, there are also amateur robot combat leagues active globally outside of the televised events.Micromouseevents, in which autonomous robots compete to solve mazes or other obstacle courses are also held internationally. Robot competitionsare also often used within educational settings to introduce the concept of robotics to children such as theFIRST Robotics Competitionin the US. Robots appear in many films. Most of the robots in cinema are fictional. Two of the most famous areR2-D2andC-3POfrom theStar Warsfranchise. The concept of humanoidsex robotshas drawn public attention and elicited debate regarding their supposed benefits and potential effects on society. Opponents argue that the introduction of such devices would be socially harmful, and demeaning to women and children,[209]while proponents cite their potential therapeutical benefits, particularly in aiding people withdementiaordepression.[210] Fears and concerns about robots have been repeatedly expressed in a wide range of books and films. A common theme is the development of a master race of conscious and highly intelligent robots, motivated to take over or destroy the human race.Frankenstein(1818), often called the first science fiction novel, has become synonymous with the theme of a robot or android advancing beyond its creator. Other works with similar themes includeThe Mechanical Man,The Terminator,Runaway,RoboCop, theReplicators inStargate, theCylonsinBattlestar Galactica, theCybermenandDaleksinDoctor Who,The Matrix,EnthiranandI, Robot. Some fictional robots are programmed to kill and destroy; others gain superhuman intelligence and abilities by upgrading their own software and hardware. Examples of popular media where the robot becomes evil are2001: A Space Odyssey,Red PlanetandEnthiran. The 2017 gameHorizon Zero Dawnexplores themes of robotics in warfare,robot ethics, and theAI control problem, as well as the positive or negative impact such technologies could have on the environment. Another common theme is the reaction, sometimes called the \"uncanny valley\", of unease and even revulsion at the sight of robots that mimic humans too closely.[110] More recently, fictional representations of artificially intelligent robots in films such asA.I. Artificial IntelligenceandEx Machinaand the 2016 TV adaptation ofWestworldhave engaged audience sympathy for the robots themselves.

Reinforcement learning is one of thethree basic machine learning paradigms, alongsidesupervised learningandunsupervised learning. Q-learningat its simplest stores data in tables. This approach becomesinfeasibleas the number of states/actions increases (e.g., if the state space or action space were continuous), as the probability of the agent visiting a particular state and performing a particular action diminishes. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input-output pairs to be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead, the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge) with the goal of maximizing the cumulative reward (the feedback of which might be incomplete or delayed).[1]The search for this balance is known as theexploration-exploitation dilemma. The environment is typically stated in the form of aMarkov decision process(MDP), as many reinforcement learning algorithms usedynamic programmingtechniques.[2]The main difference between classical dynamic programming methods and reinforcement learning algorithms is that the latter do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the Markov decision process, and they target large MDPs where exact methods become infeasible.[3] Due to its generality, reinforcement learning is studied in many disciplines, such asgame theory,control theory,operations research,information theory,simulation-based optimization,multi-agent systems,swarm intelligence, andstatistics. In the operations research and control literature, RL is calledapproximate dynamic programming, orneuro-dynamic programming.The problems of interest in RL have also been studied in thetheory of optimal control, which is concerned mostly with the existence and characterization of optimal solutions, and algorithms for their exact computation, and less with learning or approximation (particularly in the absence of a mathematical model of the environment). Basic reinforcement learning is modeled as aMarkov decision process: A set of environment and agent states (the state space),S{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {S}}}; A set of actions (the action space),A{\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {A}}}, of the agent; Pa(s,s′)=Pr(St+1=s′∣St=s,At=a){\\displaystyle P_{a}(s,s')=\\Pr(S_{t+1}=s'\\mid S_{t}=s,A_{t}=a)}, the transition probability (at timet{\\displaystyle t}) from states{\\displaystyle s}to states′{\\displaystyle s'}under actiona{\\displaystyle a}. Ra(s,s′){\\displaystyle R_{a}(s,s')}, the immediate reward after transition froms{\\displaystyle s}tos′{\\displaystyle s'}under actiona{\\displaystyle a}. The purpose of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn an optimal (or near-optimal) policy that maximizes the reward function or other user-provided reinforcement signal that accumulates from immediate rewards. This is similar toprocessesthat appear to occur in animal psychology. For example, biological brains are hardwired to interpret signals such as pain and hunger as negative reinforcements, and interpret pleasure and food intake as positive reinforcements. In some circumstances, animals learn to adopt behaviors that optimize these rewards. This suggests that animals are capable of reinforcement learning.[4][5] A basic reinforcement learning agent interacts with its environment in discrete time steps. At each time stept, the agent receives the current stateSt{\\displaystyle S_{t}}and rewardRt{\\displaystyle R_{t}}. It then chooses an actionAt{\\displaystyle A_{t}}from the set of available actions, which is subsequently sent to the environment. The environment moves to a new stateSt+1{\\displaystyle S_{t+1}}and the rewardRt+1{\\displaystyle R_{t+1}}associated with thetransition(St,At,St+1){\\displaystyle (S_{t},A_{t},S_{t+1})}is determined. The goal of a reinforcement learning agent is to learn apolicy: π:S×A→[0,1]{\\displaystyle \\pi :{\\mathcal {S}}\\times {\\mathcal {A}}\\rightarrow [0,1]},π(s,a)=Pr(At=a∣St=s){\\displaystyle \\pi (s,a)=\\Pr(A_{t}=a\\mid S_{t}=s)} that maximizes the expected cumulative reward. Formulating the problem as a Markov decision process assumes the agent directly observes the current environmental state; in this case, the problem is said to havefull observability. If the agent only has access to a subset of states, or if the observed states are corrupted by noise, the agent is said to havepartial observability, and formally the problem must be formulated as apartially observable Markov decision process. In both cases, the set of actions available to the agent can be restricted. For example, the state of an account balance could be restricted to be positive; if the current value of the state is 3 and the state transition attempts to reduce the value by 4, the transition will not be allowed. When the agent's performance is compared to that of an agent that acts optimally, the difference in performance yields the notion ofregret. In order to act near optimally, the agent must reason about long-term consequences of its actions (i.e., maximize future rewards), although the immediate reward associated with this might be negative. Thus, reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited to problems that include a long-term versus short-term reward trade-off. It has been applied successfully to various problems, includingenergy storage,[6]robot control,[7]photovoltaic generators,[8]backgammon,checkers,[9]Go(AlphaGo), andautonomous driving systems.[10] Two elements make reinforcement learning powerful: the use of samples to optimize performance, and the use offunction approximationto deal with large environments. Thanks to these two key components, RL can be used in large environments in the following situations: A model of the environment is known, but ananalytic solutionis not available; Only a simulation model of the environment is given (the subject ofsimulation-based optimization);[11] The only way to collect information about the environment is to interact with it. The first two of these problems could be considered planning problems (since some form of model is available), while the last one could be considered to be a genuine learning problem. However, reinforcement learning converts both planning problems tomachine learningproblems. The exploration vs. exploitation trade-off has been most thoroughly studied through themulti-armed banditproblem and for finite state space Markov decision processes in Burnetas and Katehakis (1997).[12] Reinforcement learning requires clever exploration mechanisms; randomly selecting actions, without reference to an estimated probability distribution, shows poor performance. The case of (small) finite Markov decision processes is relatively well understood. However, due to the lack of algorithms that scale well with the number of states (or scale to problems with infinite state spaces), simple exploration methods are the most practical. One such method isε{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }-greedy, where0<ε<1{\\displaystyle 0<\\varepsilon <1}is a parameter controlling the amount of exploration vs. exploitation.  With probability1−ε{\\displaystyle 1-\\varepsilon }, exploitation is chosen, and the agent chooses the action that it believes has the best long-term effect (ties between actions are broken uniformly at random). Alternatively, with probabilityε{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }, exploration is chosen, and the action is chosen uniformly at random.ε{\\displaystyle \\varepsilon }is usually a fixed parameter but can be adjusted either according to a schedule (making the agent explore progressively less), or adaptively based on heuristics.[13] Even if the issue of exploration is disregarded and even if the state was observable (assumed hereafter), the problem remains to use past experience to find out which actions lead to higher cumulative rewards. The agent's action selection is modeled as a map calledpolicy: The policy map gives the probability of taking actiona{\\displaystyle a}when in states{\\displaystyle s}.[14]: 61There are also deterministic policies. The state-value functionVπ(s){\\displaystyle V_{\\pi }(s)}is defined as,expected discounted returnstarting with states{\\displaystyle s}, i.e.S0=s{\\displaystyle S_{0}=s}, and successively following policyπ{\\displaystyle \\pi }. Hence, roughly speaking, the value function estimates \"how good\" it is to be in a given state.[14]: 60 where the random variableG{\\displaystyle G}denotes thediscounted return, and is defined as the sum of future discounted rewards: whereRt+1{\\displaystyle R_{t+1}}is the reward for transitioning from stateSt{\\displaystyle S_{t}}toSt+1{\\displaystyle S_{t+1}},0≤γ<1{\\displaystyle 0\\leq \\gamma <1}is thediscount rate.γ{\\displaystyle \\gamma }is less than 1, so rewards in the distant future are weighted less than rewards in the immediate future. The algorithm must find a policy with maximum expected discounted return. From the theory of Markov decision processes it is known that, without loss of generality, the search can be restricted to the set of so-calledstationarypolicies. A policy isstationaryif the action-distribution returned by it depends only on the last state visited (from the observation agent's history). The search can be further restricted todeterministicstationary policies. Adeterministic stationarypolicy deterministically selects actions based on the current state. Since any such policy can be identified with a mapping from the set of states to the set of actions, these policies can be identified with such mappings with no loss of generality. Thebrute forceapproach entails two steps: For each possible policy, sample returns while following it Choose the policy with the largest expected discounted return One problem with this is that the number of policies can be large, or even infinite. Another is that the variance of the returns may be large, which requires many samples to accurately estimate the discounted return of each policy. These problems can be ameliorated if we assume some structure and allow samples generated from one policy to influence the estimates made for others. The two main approaches for achieving this arevalue function estimationanddirect policy search. Value function approaches attempt to find a policy that maximizes the discounted return by maintaining a set of estimates of expected discounted returnsE⁡[G]{\\displaystyle \\operatorname {\\mathbb {E} } [G]}for some policy (usually either the \"current\" [on-policy] or the optimal [off-policy] one). These methods rely on the theory of Markov decision processes, where optimality is defined in a sense stronger than the one above: A policy is optimal if it achieves the best-expected discounted return fromanyinitial state (i.e., initial distributions play no role in this definition). Again, an optimal policy can always be found among stationary policies. To define optimality in a formal manner, define the state-value of a policyπ{\\displaystyle \\pi }by whereG{\\displaystyle G}stands for the discounted return associated with followingπ{\\displaystyle \\pi }from the initial states{\\displaystyle s}. DefiningV∗(s){\\displaystyle V^{*}(s)}as the maximum possible state-value ofVπ(s){\\displaystyle V^{\\pi }(s)}, whereπ{\\displaystyle \\pi }is allowed to change, A policy that achieves these optimal state-values in each state is calledoptimal. Clearly, a policy that is optimal in this sense is also optimal in the sense that it maximizes the expected discounted return, sinceV∗(s)=maxπE[G∣s,π]{\\displaystyle V^{*}(s)=\\max _{\\pi }\\mathbb {E} [G\\mid s,\\pi ]}, wheres{\\displaystyle s}is a state randomly sampled from the distributionμ{\\displaystyle \\mu }of initial states (soμ(s)=Pr(S0=s){\\displaystyle \\mu (s)=\\Pr(S_{0}=s)}). Although state-values suffice to define optimality, it is useful to define action-values. Given a states{\\displaystyle s}, an actiona{\\displaystyle a}and a policyπ{\\displaystyle \\pi }, the action-value of the pair(s,a){\\displaystyle (s,a)}underπ{\\displaystyle \\pi }is defined by whereG{\\displaystyle G}now stands for the random discounted return associated with first taking actiona{\\displaystyle a}in states{\\displaystyle s}and followingπ{\\displaystyle \\pi }, thereafter. The theory of Markov decision processes states that ifπ∗{\\displaystyle \\pi ^{*}}is an optimal policy, we act optimally (take the optimal action) by choosing the action fromQπ∗(s,⋅){\\displaystyle Q^{\\pi ^{*}}(s,\\cdot )}with the highest action-value at each state,s{\\displaystyle s}. Theaction-value functionof such an optimal policy (Qπ∗{\\displaystyle Q^{\\pi ^{*}}}) is called theoptimal action-value functionand is commonly denoted byQ∗{\\displaystyle Q^{*}}. In summary, the knowledge of the optimal action-value function alone suffices to know how to act optimally. Assuming full knowledge of the Markov decision process, the two basic approaches to compute the optimal action-value function arevalue iterationandpolicy iteration. Both algorithms compute a sequence of functionsQk{\\displaystyle Q_{k}}(k=0,1,2,…{\\displaystyle k=0,1,2,\\ldots }) that converge toQ∗{\\displaystyle Q^{*}}. Computing these functions involves computing expectations over the whole state-space, which is impractical for all but the smallest (finite) Markov decision processes. In reinforcement learning methods, expectations are approximated by averaging over samples and using function approximation techniques to cope with the need to represent value functions over large state-action spaces. Monte Carlo methods[15]are used to solve reinforcement learning problems by averaging sample returns. Unlike methods that require full knowledge of the environment’s dynamics, Monte Carlo methods rely solely on actual orsimulatedexperience—sequences of states, actions, and rewards obtained from interaction with an environment. This makes them applicable in situations where the complete dynamics are unknown. Learning from actual experience does not require prior knowledge of the environment and can still lead to optimal behavior. When using simulated experience, only a model capable of generating sample transitions is required, rather than a full specification oftransition probabilities, which is necessary fordynamic programmingmethods. Monte Carlo methods apply to episodic tasks, where experience is divided into episodes that eventually terminate. Policy and value function updates occur only after the completion of an episode, making these methods incremental on an episode-by-episode basis, though not on a step-by-step (online) basis. The term “Monte Carlo” generally refers to any method involvingrandom sampling; however, in this context, it specifically refers to methods that compute averages fromcompletereturns, rather thanpartialreturns. These methods function similarly to thebandit algorithms, in which returns are averaged for each state-action pair. The key difference is that actions taken in one state affect the returns of subsequent states within the same episode, making the problemnon-stationary. To address this non-stationarity, Monte Carlo methods use the framework of general policy iteration (GPI). While dynamic programming computesvalue functionsusing full knowledge of theMarkov decision process(MDP), Monte Carlo methods learn these functions through sample returns. The value functions and policies interact similarly to dynamic programming to achieveoptimality, first addressing the prediction problem and then extending to policy improvement and control, all based on sampled experience.[14] The first problem is corrected by allowing the procedure to change the policy (at some or all states) before the values settle. This too may be problematic as it might prevent convergence. Most current algorithms do this, giving rise to the class ofgeneralized policy iterationalgorithms. Manyactor-criticmethods belong to this category. The second issue can be corrected by allowing trajectories to contribute to any state-action pair in them. This may also help to some extent with the third problem, although a better solution when returns have high variance is Sutton'stemporal difference(TD) methods that are based on the recursiveBellman equation.[16][17]The computation in TD methods can be incremental (when after each transition the memory is changed and the transition is thrown away), or batch (when the transitions are batched and the estimates are computed once based on the batch). Batch methods, such as the least-squares temporal difference method,[18]may use the information in the samples better, while incremental methods are the only choice when batch methods are infeasible due to their high computational or memory complexity. Some methods try to combine the two approaches. Methods based on temporal differences also overcome the fourth issue. Another problem specific to TD comes from their reliance on the recursive Bellman equation. Most TD methods have a so-calledλ{\\displaystyle \\lambda }parameter(0≤λ≤1){\\displaystyle (0\\leq \\lambda \\leq 1)}that can continuously interpolate between Monte Carlo methods that do not rely on the Bellman equations and the basic TD methods that rely entirely on the Bellman equations. This can be effective in palliating this issue. In order to address the fifth issue,function approximation methodsare used.Linear function approximationstarts with a mappingϕ{\\displaystyle \\phi }that assigns a finite-dimensional vector to each state-action pair. Then, the action values of a state-action pair(s,a){\\displaystyle (s,a)}are obtained by linearly combining the components ofϕ(s,a){\\displaystyle \\phi (s,a)}with someweightsθ{\\displaystyle \\theta }: The algorithms then adjust the weights, instead of adjusting the values associated with the individual state-action pairs. Methods based on ideas fromnonparametric statistics(which can be seen to construct their own features) have been explored. Value iteration can also be used as a starting point, giving rise to theQ-learningalgorithm and its many variants.[19]Including Deep Q-learning methods when a neural network is used to represent Q, with various applications in stochastic search problems.[20] The problem with using action-values is that they may need highly precise estimates of the competing action values that can be hard to obtain when the returns are noisy, though this problem is mitigated to some extent by temporal difference methods. Using the so-called compatible function approximation method compromises generality and efficiency. An alternative method is to search directly in (some subset of) the policy space, in which case the problem becomes a case ofstochastic optimization. The two approaches available are gradient-based and gradient-free methods. Gradient-based methods (policy gradient methods) start with a mapping from a finite-dimensional (parameter) space to the space of policies: given the parameter vectorθ{\\displaystyle \\theta }, letπθ{\\displaystyle \\pi _{\\theta }}denote the policy associated toθ{\\displaystyle \\theta }. Defining the performance function byρ(θ)=ρπθ{\\displaystyle \\rho (\\theta )=\\rho ^{\\pi _{\\theta }}}under mild conditions this function will be differentiable as a function of the parameter vectorθ{\\displaystyle \\theta }. If the gradient ofρ{\\displaystyle \\rho }was known, one could usegradient ascent. Since an analytic expression for the gradient is not available, only a noisy estimate is available. Such an estimate can be constructed in many ways, giving rise to algorithms such as Williams' REINFORCE method[21](which is known as the likelihood ratio method in thesimulation-based optimizationliterature).[22] A large class of methods avoids relying on gradient information. These includesimulated annealing,cross-entropy searchor methods ofevolutionary computation. Many gradient-free methods can achieve (in theory and in the limit) a global optimum. Policy search methods may converge slowly given noisy data. For example, this happens in episodic problems when the trajectories are long and the variance of the returns is large. Value-function based methods that rely on temporal differences might help in this case. In recent years,actor–critic methodshave been proposed and performed well on various problems.[23] Policy search methods have been used in theroboticscontext.[24]Many policy search methods may get stuck in local optima (as they are based onlocal search). Finally, all of the above methods can be combined with algorithms that first learn a model of theMarkov Decision Process, the probability of each next state given an action taken from an existing state. For instance, the Dyna algorithm[25]learns a model from experience, and uses that to provide more modelled transitions for a value function, in addition to the real transitions.  Such methods can sometimes be extended to use of non-parametric models, such as when the transitions are simply stored and 'replayed'[26]to the learning algorithm. Model-based methods can be more computationally intensive than model-free approaches, and their utility can be limited by the extent to which the Markov Decision Process can be learnt.[27] There are other ways to use models than to update a value function.[28]For instance, inmodel predictive controlthe model is used to update the behavior directly. Both the asymptotic and finite-sample behaviors of most algorithms are well understood. Algorithms with provably good online performance (addressing the exploration issue) are known. Efficient exploration of Markov decision processes is given in  Burnetas and Katehakis (1997).[12]Finite-time performance bounds have also appeared for many algorithms, but these bounds are expected to be rather loose and thus more work is needed to better understand the relative advantages and limitations. For incremental algorithms, asymptotic convergence issues have been settled[clarification needed]. Temporal-difference-based algorithms converge under a wider set of conditions than was previously possible (for example, when used with arbitrary, smooth function approximation). Research topics include: actor-critic architecture[29] actor-critic-scenery architecture[3] adaptive methods that work with fewer (or no) parameters under a large number of conditions bug detection in software projects[30] continuous learning combinations with logic-based frameworks[31] exploration in large Markov decision processes human feedback[32] interaction between implicit and explicit learning in skill acquisition intrinsic motivationwhich differentiates information-seeking, curiosity-type behaviours from task-dependent goal-directed behaviours large-scale empirical evaluations large (or continuous) action spaces modular and hierarchical reinforcement learning[33] multiagent/distributed reinforcement learning is a topic of interest. Applications are expanding.[34] occupant-centric control optimization of computing resources[35][36][37] partial information(e.g., usingpredictive state representation) reward function based on maximising novel information[38][39][40] sample-based planning (e.g., based onMonte Carlo tree search). securities trading[41] transfer learning[42] TD learning modelingdopamine-based learning in the brain.Dopaminergicprojections from thesubstantia nigrato thebasal gangliafunction are the prediction error. value-function and policy search methods Associative reinforcement learning tasks combine facets of stochastic learning automata tasks and supervised learning pattern classification tasks. In associative reinforcement learning tasks, the learning system interacts in a closed loop with its environment.[46] This approach extends reinforcement learning by using a deep neural network and without explicitly designing the state space.[47]The work on learning ATARI games by GoogleDeepMindincreased attention todeep reinforcement learningorend-to-end reinforcement learning.[48] Adversarial deep reinforcement learning is an active area of research in reinforcement learning focusing on vulnerabilities of learned policies. In this research area some studies initially showed that reinforcement learning policies are susceptible to imperceptible adversarial manipulations.[49][50][51]While some methods have been proposed to overcome these susceptibilities, in the most recent studies it has been shown that these proposed solutions are far from providing an accurate representation of current vulnerabilities of deep reinforcement learning policies.[52] By introducingfuzzy inferencein reinforcement learning,[53]approximating the state-action value function withfuzzy rulesin continuous space becomes possible. The IF - THEN form of fuzzy rules make this approach suitable for expressing the results in a form close to natural language. Extending FRL with Fuzzy Rule Interpolation[54]allows the use of reduced size sparse fuzzy rule-bases to emphasize cardinal rules (most important state-action values). In inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), no reward function is given. Instead, the reward function is inferred given an observed behavior from an expert. The idea is to mimic observed behavior, which is often optimal or close to optimal.[55]One popular IRL paradigm is named maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (MaxEnt IRL).[56]MaxEnt IRL estimates the parameters of a linear model of the reward function by maximizing the entropy of the probability distribution of observed trajectories subject to constraints related to matching expected feature counts. Recently it has been shown that MaxEnt IRL is a particular case of a more general framework named random utility inverse reinforcement learning (RU-IRL).[57]RU-IRL is based onrandom utility theoryand Markov decision processes. While prior IRL approaches assume that the apparent random behavior of an observed agent is due to it following a random policy, RU-IRL assumes that the observed agent follows a deterministic policy but randomness in observed behavior is due to the fact that an observer only has partial access to the features the observed agent uses in decision making. The utility function is modeled as a random variable to account for the ignorance of the observer regarding the features the observed agent actually considers in its utility function. Safe reinforcement learning (SRL) can be defined as the process of learning policies that maximize the expectation of the return in problems in which it is important to ensure reasonable system performance and/or respect safety constraints during the learning and/or deployment processes.[58]An alternative approach is risk-averse reinforcement learning, where instead of theexpectedreturn, arisk-measureof the return is optimized, such as theConditional Value at Risk(CVaR).[59]In addition to mitigating risk, the CVaR objective increases robustness to model uncertainties.[60][61]However, CVaR optimization in risk-averse RL requires special care, to prevent gradient bias[62]and blindness to success.[63] Self-reinforcement learning (or self learning), is a learning paradigm which does not use the concept of immediate reward Ra(s,s') after transition from s to s' with action a. It does not use an external reinforcement, it only uses the agent internal self-reinforcement. The internal self-reinforcement is provided by mechanism of feelings and emotions. In the learning process emotions are backpropagated by a mechanism of secondary reinforcement. The learning equation does not include the immediate reward, it only includes the state evaluation. The self-reinforcement algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine:\n1. in situation s perform action a\n2. receive a consequence situation s'\n3. compute state evaluation v(s') of how good is to be in the consequence situation s'\n4. update crossbar memory w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s') Initial conditions of the memory are received as input from the genetic environment. It is a system with only one input (situation), and only one output (action, or behavior). Self reinforcement (self learning) was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-reinforcement learning, named Crossbar Adaptive Array (CAA).[64][65]The CAA computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence states. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.[66] Efficient comparison of RL algorithms is essential for research, deployment and monitoring of RL systems. To compare different algorithms on a given environment, an agent can be trained for each algorithm. Since the performance is sensitive to implementation details, all algorithms should be implemented as closely as possible to each other.[67]After the training is finished, the agents can be run on a sample of test episodes, and their scores (returns) can be compared. Since episodes are typically assumed to bei.i.d, standard statistical tools can be used for hypothesis testing, such asT-testandpermutation test.[68]This requires to accumulate all the rewards within an episode into a single number - the episodic return. However, this causes a loss of information, as different time-steps are averaged together, possibly with different levels of noise. Whenever the noise level varies across the episode, the statistical power can be improved significantly, by weighting the rewards according to their estimated noise.[69] Temporal difference learning Q-learning State–action–reward–state–action(SARSA) Reinforcement learning from human feedback Optimal control Error-driven learning Multi-agent reinforcement learning Apprenticeship learning Model-free (reinforcement learning) Model-based reinforcement learning Direct reinforcement learning[3][70] Indirect reinforcement learning[3][70] active learning (machine learning) ^Kaelbling, Leslie P.;Littman, Michael L.;Moore, Andrew W.(1996).\"Reinforcement Learning: A Survey\".Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.4: 237–285.arXiv:cs/9605103.doi:10.1613/jair.301.S2CID1708582.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Operating_System", "text": " Robot Operating System(ROSorros) is anopen-sourcerobotics middlewaresuite. Although ROS is not anoperating system(OS) but a set ofsoftware frameworksforrobot softwaredevelopment, it provides services designed for a heterogeneouscomputer clustersuch ashardware abstraction, low-leveldevice control, implementation of commonly used functionality,message-passing between processes, andpackage management. Running sets of ROS-based processes are represented in agrapharchitecture where processing takes place in nodes that may receive, post, andmultiplexsensor data, control, state, planning, actuator, and other messages. Despite the importance of reactivity andlow latencyin robot control, ROS isnotareal-time operating system(RTOS). However, it is possible to integrate ROS withreal-time computingcode.[3]The lack of support for real-time systems has been addressed in the creation of ROS 2,[4][5][6]a major revision of the ROS API which will take advantage of modern libraries and technologies for core ROS functions and add support for real-time code andembedded systemhardware. Software in the ROSEcosystem[7]can be separated into three groups: language- and platform-independent tools used for building and distributing ROS-based software; ROS client library implementations such as roscpp,[8]rospy,[9]and roslisp;[10] packages containing application-related code which uses one or more ROS client libraries.[11] Both the language-independent tools and the main client libraries (C++,Python, andLisp) are released under the terms of theBSD license, and as such areopen-source softwareand free for both commercial and research use. The majority of other packages are licensed under a variety ofopen-source licenses. These other packages implement commonly used functionality and applications such as hardware drivers, robot models, datatypes, planning,perception,simultaneous localization and mapping(SLAM),simulation tools, and otheralgorithms. The main ROS client libraries are geared toward aUnix-likesystem, mostly because of their dependence on large sets of open-source software dependencies. For these client libraries,Ubuntu Linuxis listed as \"Supported\" while other variants such asFedora Linux,macOS, andMicrosoft Windowsare designated \"experimental\" and are supported by the community.[12]The native Java ROS client library, rosjava,[13]however, does not share these limitations and has enabled ROS-based software to be written for theAndroid OS.[14]rosjava has also enabled ROS to be integrated into an officially supportedMATLABtoolbox which can be used onLinux,macOS, and Microsoft Windows.[15]AJavaScriptclient library, roslibjs[16]has also been developed which enables integration of software into a ROS system via any standards-compliant web browser. Sometime before 2007, the first pieces of what eventually would become ROS began coalescing atStanford University.[17][18]Eric Berger and Keenan Wyrobek, PhD students working in Kenneth Salisbury's[19]robotics laboratory at Stanford, were leading the Personal Robotics Program.[20]While working on robots to do manipulation tasks in human environments, the two students noticed that many of their colleagues were held back by the diverse nature of robotics: an excellent software developer might not have the hardware knowledge required, someone developing state of the art path planning might not know how to do the computer vision required. In an attempt to remedy this situation, the two students set out to make a baseline system that would provide a starting place for others in academia to build upon. In the words of Eric Berger, \"something that didn’t suck, in all of those different dimensions\".[17] In their first steps towards this unifying system, the two built thePR1as a hardware prototype and began to work on software from it, borrowing the best practices from other early open-source robotic software frameworks, particularly switchyard, a system that Morgan Quigley, another Stanford PhD student, had been working on in support of the STanford Artificial Intelligence Robot (STAIR)[21][22][23][24]by theStanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Early funding of US$50,000 was provided byJoanna HoffmanandAlain Rossmann, which supported the development of the PR1. While seeking funding for further development,[25]Eric Berger and Keenan Wyrobek met Scott Hassan, the founder ofWillow Garage, atechnology incubatorwhich was working on an autonomous SUV and a solar autonomous boat. Hassan shared Berger and Wyrobek's vision of a \"Linux for robotics\", and invited them to come and work at Willow Garage. Willow Garage was started in January 2007, and the first commit of ROS code was made to SourceForge on 7 November 2007.[26] Willow Garagebegan developing the PR2 robot as a follow-up to the PR1, and ROS as the software to run it. Groups from more than twenty institutions made contributions to ROS, both the core software and the growing number of packages which worked with ROS to form a greater software ecosystem.[27][28]That people outside of Willow were contributing to ROS (especially from Stanford's STAIR project) meant that ROS was a multi-robot platform from the start. While Willow Garage had originally had other projects in progress, they were scrapped in favor of the Personal Robotics Program: focused on producing the PR2 as a research platform for academia and ROS as the open-source robotics stack that would underlie both academic research and tech startups, much like theLAMP stackdid for web-based startups. In December 2008, Willow Garage met the first of their three internal milestones: continuous navigation for the PR2 over a period of two days and a distance of pi kilometers.[29]Soon after, an early version of ROS (0.4 Mango Tango)[30]was released, followed by the first RVIZ documentation and the first paper on ROS.[28]In early summer, the second internal milestone: having the PR2 navigate the office, open doors, and plug itself it in, was reached.[31]This was followed in August by the initiation of the ROS.org website.[32]Early tutorials on ROS were posted in December,[33]preparing for the release of ROS 1.0, in January 2010.[34]This was Milestone 3: producing tons of documentation and tutorials for the enormous abilities that Willow Garage's engineers had developed over the preceding 3 years. Following this, Willow Garage achieved one of its longest held goals: giving away 10 PR2 robots to worthy academic institutions. This had long been a goal of the founders, as they felt that the PR2 could kick-start robotics research around the world. They ended up awarding eleven PR2s to different institutions, includingUniversity of Freiburg(Germany),Robert Bosch GmbH,Georgia Institute of Technology,KU Leuven(Belgium),Massachusetts Institute of Technology(MIT),Stanford University,Technical University of Munich(Germany),University of California, Berkeley,University of Pennsylvania,University of Southern California(USC), andUniversity of Tokyo(Japan).[35]This, combined with Willow Garage's highly successful internship program[36](run from 2008 to 2010 byMelonee Wise), helped to spread the word about ROS throughout the robotics world. The first official ROS distribution release: ROS Box Turtle, was released on 2 March 2010, marking the first time that ROS was officially distributed with a set of versioned packages for public use. These developments led to the first drone running ROS,[37]the first autonomous car running ROS,[38]and the adaption of ROS forLego Mindstorms.[39]With the PR2 Beta program well underway, the PR2 robot was officially released for commercial purchase on 9 September 2010.[40] 2011 was a banner year for ROS with the launch of ROS Answers, a Q/A forum for ROS users, on 15 February;[41]the introduction of the highly successfulTurtleBotrobot kit on 18 April;[42]and the total number of ROS repositories passing 100 on 5 May.[43]Willow Garage began 2012 by creating theOpen Source Robotics Foundation(OSRF)[44]in April. The OSRF was immediately awarded a software contract by theDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA).[45]Later that year, the first ROSCon was held in St. Paul, Minnesota,[46]the first book on ROS,ROS By Example,[47]was published, andBaxter, the first commercial robot to run ROS, was announced byRethink Robotics.[48]Soon after passing its fifth anniversary in November, ROS began running on every continent on 3 December 2012.[49] In February 2013, the OSRF became the primary software maintainers for ROS,[50]foreshadowing the announcement in August that Willow Garage would be absorbed by its founders,Suitable Technologies.[51]At this point, ROS had released seven major versions (up to ROS Groovy),[52]and had users all over the globe. This chapter of ROS development would be finalized whenClearpath Roboticstook over support responsibilities for the PR2 in early 2014.[53] In the years since OSRF took over primary development of ROS, a new version has been released every year,[52]while interest in ROS continues to grow. ROSCons have occurred every year since 2012, co-located with eitherICRAorIROS, two flagship robotics conferences. Meetups of ROS developers have been organized in a variety of countries,[54][55][56]a number of ROS books have been published,[57]and many educational programs initiated.[58][59]On 1 September 2014,NASAannounced the first robot to run ROS in space:Robotnaut 2, on theInternational Space Station.[60]In 2017, the OSRF changed its name toOpen Robotics. Tech giantsAmazonandMicrosoftbegan to take an interest in ROS during this time, with Microsoft porting core ROS to Windows in September 2018,[61]followed by Amazon Web Services releasing RoboMaker in November 2018.[62] Perhaps the most important development of the OSRF/Open Robotics years thus far (not to discount the explosion of robot platforms which began to support ROS or the enormous improvements in each ROS version) was the proposal of ROS 2, a significant API change to ROS which is intended to supportreal-time programming, a wider variety of computing environments, and more modern technology.[63]ROS 2 was announced at ROSCon 2014,[64]the first commits to the ros2 repository were made in February 2015, followed by alpha releases in August 2015.[65]The first distribution release of ROS 2, Ardent Apalone, was released on 8 December 2017,[65]ushering in a new era of next-generation ROS development. ROS was designed to be open source, intending that users would be able to choose the configuration of tools and libraries which interacted with the core of ROS so that users could shift their software stacks to fit their robot and application area. As such, there is very little which is core to ROS, beyond the general structure within which programs must exist and communicate. In one sense, ROS is the underlying plumbing behind nodes and message passing. However, in reality, ROS is not only that plumbing, but a rich and mature set of tools, a wide-ranging set of robot-agnostic abilities provided by packages, and a greater ecosystem of additions to ROS. ROS processes are represented as nodes in a graph structure, connected by edges called topics.[66]ROS nodes can pass messages to one another through topics, make service calls to other nodes, provide a service for other nodes, or set or retrieve shared data from a communal database called the parameter server. A process called the ROS Master[66]makes all of this possible by registering nodes to itself, setting up node-to-node communication for topics, and controlling parameter server updates. Messages and service calls do not pass through the master, rather the master sets up peer-to-peer communication between all node processes after they register themselves with the master. This decentralized architecture lends itself well to robots, which often consist of a subset of networked computer hardware, and may communicate with off-board computers for heavy computing or commands. A node represents one process running the ROS graph. Every node has a name, which it registers with the ROS master before it can take any other actions. Multiple nodes with different names can exist under differentnamespaces, or a node can be defined as anonymous, in which case it will randomly generate an additional identifier to add to its given name. Nodes are at the center of ROS programming, as most ROS client code is in the form of a ROS node which takes actions based on information received from other nodes, sends information to other nodes, or sends and receives requests for actions to and from other nodes. Topics are namedbusesover which nodes send and receive messages.[67]Topic names must be unique within their namespace as well. To send messages to a topic, a node must publish to said topic, while to receive messages it must subscribe. The publish/subscribe model is anonymous: no node knows which nodes are sending or receiving on a topic, only that it is sending/receiving on that topic. The types of messages passed on a topic vary widely and can be user-defined. The content of these messages can be sensor data, motor control commands, state information, actuator commands, or anything else. A node may also advertise services.[68]A service represents an action that a node can take which will have a single result. As such, services are often used for actions which have a defined start and end, such as capturing a one-frame image, rather than processing velocity commands to a wheel motor or odometer data from a wheel encoder. Nodes advertise services and call services from one another. The parameter server[68]is a database shared between nodes which allows for communal access to static or semi-static information. Data which does not change frequently and as such will be infrequently accessed, such as the distance between two fixed points in the environment, or the weight of the robot, are good candidates for storage in the parameter server. ROS's core functionality is augmented by a variety of tools which allow developers to visualize and record data, easily navigate the ROS package structures, and create scripts automating complex configuration and setup processes. The addition of these tools greatly increases the abilities of systems using ROS by simplifying and providing solutions to a number of common robotics development problems. These tools are provided in packages like any other algorithm, but rather than providing implementations of hardware drivers or algorithms for various robotic tasks, these packages provide task and robot-agnostic tools which come with the core of most modern ROS installations. rviz[69](Robot Visualization tool) is a three-dimensional visualizer used to visualize robots, the environments they work in, and sensor data. It is a highly configurable tool, with many different types of visualizations and plugins. Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) is anXMLfile format for robot model description. rosbag[70]is a command line tool used to record and playback ROS message data. rosbag uses a file format called bags,[71]which log ROS messages by listening to topics and recording messages as they come in. Playing messages back from a bag is largely the same as having the original nodes which produced the data in the ROS computation graph, making bags a useful tool for recording data to be used in later development. While rosbag is a command line only tool, rqt_bag[72]provides a GUI interface to rosbag. catkin[73]is the ROS build system, having replaced rosbuild[74]as of ROS Groovy. catkin is based onCMake, and is similarly cross-platform, open-source, and language-independent. The rosbash[75]package provides a suite of tools which augment the functionality of thebash shell. These tools include rosls, roscd, and roscp, which replicate the functionalities ofls,cd, andcprespectively. The ROS versions of these tools allow users to use ros package names in place of the file path where the package is located. The package also adds tab-completion to most ROS utilities, and includes rosed, which edits a given file with the chosen default text editor, as well rosrun, which runs executables in ROS packages. rosbash supports the same functionalities forzshandtcsh, to a lesser extent. roslaunch[76]is a tool used to launch multiple ROS nodes both locally and remotely, as well as setting parameters on the ROS parameter server. roslaunch configuration files, which are written usingXMLcan easily automate a complex startup and configuration process into a single command. roslaunch scripts can include other roslaunch scripts, launch nodes on specific machines, and even restart processes which die during execution. ROS contains many open-source implementations of common robotics functionality and algorithms. These open-source implementations are organized into packages. Many packages are included as part of ROS distributions, while others may be developed by individuals and distributed through code sharing sites such as github. Some packages of note include: actionlib[77]provides a standardized interface for interfacing with preemptable tasks. nodelet[78]provides a way to run multiple algorithms in a single process. rosbridge[79]provides a JSON API to ROS functionalities for non-ROS programs. slam toolbox[80]provides full 2D SLAM and localization system. gmapping[81]provides a wrapper forOpenSlam'sGmappingalgorithm forsimultaneous localization and mapping. cartographer[82]provides real time 2D and 3D SLAM algorithms developed atGoogle. amcl[83]provides an implementation ofadaptive Monte-Carlo localization. navigation[84]provides the capability of navigating a mobile robot in a planar environment. MoveIt![85]provides motion planning capabilities forrobot manipulators. Its default planning library is theOpen Motion Planning Library (OMPL).[86] vision_opencv[87]is a meta-package which provides packages for integrating ROS withOpenCV. tf[88]provided a system for representing, tracking and transforming coordinate frames until ROS Hydro, when it was deprecated in favor of tf2. tf2[89]is the second generation of the tf library, and provides the same abilities for ROS versions after Hydro. gazebo_ros_pkgs[90]is a meta-package which provides packages for integrating ROS with theGazebosimulator. stage[91]provides an interface for the 2DStagesimulator. ROS releases may be incompatible with other releases and are often referred to by code name rather than version number. ROS currently releases a version every year in May, following the release of Ubuntu LTS versions.[92]ROS 2 currently releases a new version every six months (in December and July). These releases are supported for a single year. There are currently two active major versions seeing releases: ROS 1 and ROS 2. Aside to this there is the ROS-Industrial or ROS-I derivate project since at least 2012. ROS-Industrial[108]is an open-source project (BSD (legacy)/Apache 2.0 (preferred) license) that extends the advanced abilities of ROS to manufacturing automation and robotics. In the industrial environment, there are two different approaches to programming a robot: either through an external proprietary controller, typically implemented using ROS, or via the respective native programming language of the robot. ROS can therefore be seen as the software-based approach to program industrial robots instead of the classic robot controller-based approach. The ROS-Industrial repository includes interfaces for common industrial manipulators, grippers, sensors, and device networks. It also provides software libraries for automatic 2D/3D sensor calibration, process path/motion planning, applications like Scan-N-Plan, developer tools like the Qt Creator ROS Plugin, and training curriculum that is specific to the needs of manufacturers. ROS-I is supported by an international Consortium of industry and research members. The project began as a collaborative endeavor between Yaskawa Motoman Robotics, Southwest Research Institute, and Willow Garage to support the use of ROS for manufacturing automation, with the GitHub repository being founded in January 2012 by Shaun Edwards (SwRI). Currently, the Consortium is divided into three groups; the ROS-Industrial Consortium Americas (led by SwRI and located in San Antonio, Texas), the ROS-Industrial Consortium Europe (led by Fraunhofer IPA and located in Stuttgart, Germany) and the ROS-Industrial Consortium Asia Pacific (led by Advanced Remanufacturing and Technology Centre (ARTC) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and located in Singapore). The Consortia supports the global ROS-Industrial community by conducting ROS-I training, providing technical support and setting the future roadmap for ROS-I, as well as conducting precompetitive joint industry projects to develop new ROS-I abilities.[109] ABB, Adept,Fanuc,Motoman, andUniversal Robotsare supported byROS-Industrial.[110] Baxter[111]atRethink Robotics, Inc.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent", "text": "In intelligence and artificial intelligence, anintelligent agent(IA) is an agent thatperceives its environment, takes actions autonomously in order to achieve goals, and may improve its performance withlearningor acquiringknowledge. An intelligent agent may be simple or complex: Athermostator othercontrol systemis considered an example of an intelligent agent, as is ahuman being, as is any system that meets the definition, such as afirm, astate, or abiome.[1] Leading AI textbooks define \"artificial intelligence\" as the \"study and design of intelligent agents\", a definition that considers goal-directed behavior to be the essence of intelligence. Goal-directed agents are also described using a term borrowed fromeconomics, \"rational agent\".[1] An agent has an \"objective function\" that encapsulates all the IA's goals. Such an agent is designed to create and execute whatever plan will, upon completion, maximize theexpected valueof the objective function.[2] For example, areinforcement learningagent has a \"reward function\" that allows the programmers to shape the IA's desired behavior,[3]and anevolutionary algorithm's behavior is shaped by a \"fitness function\".[4] Intelligent agents in artificial intelligence are closely related toagentsineconomics, and versions of the intelligent agentparadigmare studied incognitive science,ethics, and the philosophy ofpractical reason, as well as in manyinterdisciplinarysocio-cognitivemodelingand computersocial simulations. Intelligent agents are often described schematically as an abstract functional system similar to a computer program. Abstract descriptions of intelligent agents are calledabstract intelligent agents(AIA) to distinguish them from their real-world implementations. Anautonomous intelligent agentis designed to function in the absence of human intervention. Intelligent agents are also closely related tosoftware agents. Anautonomouscomputer program that carries out tasks on behalf of users. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach[5][6][2]defines an \"agent\" as \"Anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators\" It defines a \"rational agent\" as: \"An agent that acts so as to maximize the expected value of a performance measure based on past experience and knowledge.\" It also defines the field of \"artificial intelligence research\" as: \"The study and design of rational agents\" Padgham & Winikoff (2005) agree that an intelligent agent is situated in an environment and responds in a timely (though not necessarily real-time) manner to changes in the environment. However, intelligent agents must also proactively pursue goals in a flexible and robust way.[a]Optional desiderata include that the agent berational, and that the agent be capable ofbelief-desire-intentionanalysis.[7] Kaplanand Haenlein define artificial intelligence as \"a system's ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation\".[8]This definition is closely related to that of an intelligent agent. Philosophically, this definition of artificial intelligence avoids several lines of criticism. Unlike theTuring test, it does not refer to human intelligence in any way. Thus, there is no need to discuss if it is \"real\" vs \"simulated\" intelligence (i.e.,\"synthetic\"vs \"artificial\" intelligence) and does not indicate that such a machine has amind,consciousnessor trueunderstanding. It seems not imply John Searle's \"strong AI hypothesis\". It also doesn't attempt to draw a sharp dividing line between behaviors that are \"intelligent\" and behaviors that are \"unintelligent\"—programs need only be measured in terms of their objective function. More importantly, it has a number of practical advantages that have helped move AI research forward. It provides a reliable and scientific way to test programs; researchers can directly compare or even combine different approaches to isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given \"goal function\". It also gives them a common language to communicate with other fields—such asmathematical optimization(which is defined in terms of \"goals\") oreconomics(which uses the same definition of a \"rational agent\").[9] An agent that is assigned an explicit \"goal function\" is considered more intelligent if it consistently takes actions that successfully maximize its programmed goal function. The goal can be simple: 1 if the IA wins a game ofGo, 0 otherwise. Or the goal can be complex: Perform actions mathematically similar to ones that succeeded in the past. The \"goal function\" encapsulates all of the goals the agent is driven to act on; in the case of rational agents, the function alsoencapsulatesthe acceptable trade-offs between accomplishing conflicting goals. Terminology varies. For example, some agents seek to maximize or minimize an \"utility function\", \"objective function\" or \"loss function\".[6][2] Goals can be explicitly defined or induced. If the AI is programmed for \"reinforcement learning\", it has a \"reward function\" that encourages some types of behavior and punishes others. Alternatively, anevolutionary systemcan induce goals by using a \"fitness function\" to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems, similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food.[10] Some AI systems, such asnearest-neighbor, instead ofreason by analogy, these systems are not generally given goals, except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data.[11]Such systems can still bebenchmarkedif the non-goal system is framed as a system whose \"goal\" is to accomplish its narrow classification task.[12] Systems that are not traditionally considered agents, such asknowledge-representation systems, are sometimes subsumed into theparadigmbyframingthem as agents that have a goal of (for example) answering questions as accurately as possible; the concept of an \"action\" is here extended to encompass the \"act\" of giving an answer to a question. As an additional extension, mimicry-driven systems can be framed as agents who are optimizing a \"goal function\" based on how closely the IA succeeds in mimicking the desired behavior.[6][2]In thegenerative adversarial networksof the 2010s, an \"encoder\"/\"generator\" component attempts to mimic and improvise human text composition. The generator is attempting to maximize a function encapsulating how well it can fool an antagonistic \"predictor\"/\"discriminator\" component.[13] Whilesymbolic AIsystems often accept an explicit goal function, the paradigm can also be applied toneural networksand toevolutionary computing.Reinforcement learningcan generate intelligent agents that appear to act in ways intended to maximize a \"reward function\".[14]Sometimes, rather than setting the reward function to be directly equal to the desired benchmark evaluation function, machine learning programmers will use reward shaping to initially give the machine rewards for incremental progress in learning.[15]Yann LeCunstated in 2018, \"Most of the learning algorithms that people have come up with essentially consist of minimizing some objective function.\"[16]AlphaZerochess had a simple objective function; each win counted as +1 point, and each loss counted as -1 point. An objective function for a self-driving car would have to be more complicated.[17]Evolutionary computing can evolve intelligent agents that appear to act in ways intended to maximize a \"fitness function\" that influences how many descendants each agent is allowed to leave.[4] The mathematical formalism ofAIXIwas proposed as a maximally intelligent agent in this paradigm.[18]However, AIXI isuncomputable. In the real world, an IA is constrained by finite time and hardware resources, and scientists compete to produce algorithms that can achieve progressively higher scores on benchmark tests with existing hardware.[19] A simple agent program can be defined mathematically as afunctionf (called the \"agent function\")[20]which maps every possible percepts sequence to a possible action the agent can perform or to a coefficient, feedback element, function or constant that affects eventual actions: Agent function is an abstract concept as it could incorporate various principles of decision making like calculation ofutilityof individual options, deduction over logic rules,fuzzy logic, etc.[21] The program agent, instead, maps every possible percept to an action.[22] We use the term percept to refer to the agent's perceptional inputs at any given instant. In the following figures, an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators. Russell & Norvig (2003)group agents into five classes based on their degree of perceived intelligence and capability:[23] Simple reflex agents act only on the basis of the currentpercept, ignoring the rest of the percept history. The agent function is based on thecondition-action rule: \"if condition, then action\". This agent function only succeeds when the environment is fully observable. Some reflex agents can also contain information on their current state which allows them to disregard conditions whose actuators are already triggered. Infinite loops are often unavoidable for simple reflex agents operating in partially observable environments. If the agent can randomize its actions, it may be possible to escape from infinite loops. A model-based agent can handle partially observable environments. Its current state is stored inside the agent maintaining some kind of structure that describes the part of the world which cannot be seen. This knowledge about \"how the world works\" is called a model of the world, hence the name \"model-based agent\". A model-based reflex agent should maintain some sort ofinternal modelthat depends on the percept history and thereby reflects at least some of the unobserved aspects of the current state. Percept history and impact of action on the environment can be determined by using the internal model. It then chooses an action in the same way as reflex agent. An agent may also use models to describe and predict the behaviors of other agents in the environment.[24] Goal-based agents further expand on the capabilities of the model-based agents, by using \"goal\" information. Goal information describes situations that are desirable. This provides the agent a way to choose among multiple possibilities, selecting the one which reaches a goal state. Search andplanningare the subfields of artificial intelligence devoted to finding action sequences that achieve the agent's goals. Goal-based agents only distinguish between goal states and non-goal states. It is also possible to define a measure of how desirable a particular state is. This measure can be obtained through the use of autility functionwhich maps a state to a measure of the utility of the state. A more general performance measure should allow acomparisonof different world states according to how well they satisfied the agent's goals. The term utility can be used to describe how \"happy\" the agent is. A rational utility-based agent chooses the action that maximizes the expected utility of the action outcomes - that is, what the agent expects to derive, on average, given the probabilities and utilities of each outcome. A utility-based agent has to model and keep track of its environment, tasks that have involved a great deal of research on perception, representation, reasoning, and learning. Learning has the advantage of allowing agents to initially operate in unknown environments and become more competent than their initial knowledge alone might allow. The most important distinction is between the \"learning element\", responsible for making improvements, and the \"performance element\", responsible for selecting external actions. The learning element uses feedback from the \"critic\" on how the agent is doing and determines how the performance element, or \"actor\", should be modified to do better in the future. The performance element, previously considered the entire agent, takes in percepts and decides on actions. The last component of the learning agent is the \"problem generator\". It is responsible for suggesting actions that will lead to new and informative experiences. Weiss (2013)defines four classes of agents: Logic-based agents – in which the decision about what action to perform is made vialogical deduction. Reactive agents – in which decision making is implemented in some form of direct mapping from situation to action. Belief-desire-intention agents – in which decision making depends upon the manipulation ofdata structuresrepresenting the beliefs, desires, and intentions of the agent; and finally, Layered architectures – in which decision-making is realized via various software layers, each of which is more or less explicitly reasoning about the environment at different levels of abstraction In 2013, Alexander Wissner-Gross published a theory pertaining toFreedomandIntelligencefor intelligent agents.[25][26] Intelligent agents can be organized hierarchically into multiple \"sub-agents\". Intelligent sub-agents process and perform lower-level functions. Taken together, the intelligent agent and sub-agents create a complete system that can accomplish difficult tasks or goals with behaviors and responses that display a form of intelligence. Generally, an agent can be constructed by separating the body into the sensors and actuators, and so that it operates with a complex perception system that takes the description of the world as input for a controller and outputs commands to the actuator. However, a hierarchy of controller layers is often necessary to balance the immediate reaction desired for low-level tasks and the slow reasoning about complex, high-level goals.[27] \"Intelligent agent\" is also often used as a vague term, sometimes synonymous with \"virtual personal assistant\".[28]Some 20th-century definitions characterize an agent as a program that aids a user or that acts on behalf of a user.[29]These examples are known assoftware agents, and sometimes an \"intelligent software agent\" (that is, a software agent with intelligence) is referred to as an \"intelligent agent\". According toNikola Kasabov, IA systems should exhibit the following characteristics:[30] Accommodate newproblem solvingrules incrementally Adaptonlineand inreal time Are able to analyzethemselvesin terms of behavior, error and success. Learn and improve through interaction with the environment (embodiment) Learn quickly from large amounts ofdata Have memory-based exemplarstorageand retrieval capacities Haveparametersto represent short- and long-term memory, age, forgetting, etc. Hallerbach et al. discussed the application of agent-based approaches for the development and validation of automated driving systems via a digital twin of the vehicle-under-test and microscopic traffic simulation based on independent agents.[31]Waymohas created a multi-agent simulation environment, Carcraft, to test algorithms forself-driving cars.[32][33]It simulates traffic interactions between human drivers, pedestrians and automated vehicles. People's behavior is imitated by artificial agents based on data of real human behavior. The basic idea of using agent-based modeling to understand self-driving cars was discussed as early as 2003.[34] Ambient intelligence Artificial intelligence systems integration Autonomous agent Cognitive architectures Cognitive radio– a practical field for implementation Cybernetics DAYDREAMER Embodied agent Federated search– the ability for agents to search heterogeneous data sources using a single vocabulary Friendly artificial intelligence Fuzzy agents– IA implemented with adaptivefuzzy logic GOAL agent programming language Hybrid intelligent system Intelligent control Intelligent system JACK Intelligent Agents Multi-agent systemandmultiple-agent system– multiple interactive agents Reinforcement learning Semantic Web– making data on the Web available for automated processing by agents Social simulation Software agent Software bot ^The Padgham & Winikoff definition explicitly covers only social agents that interact with other agents. ^abRussell & Norvig 2003, chpt. 2. ^abcdBringsjord, Selmer; Govindarajulu, Naveen Sundar (12 July 2018).\"Artificial Intelligence\".

The termagentis derived from theLatinagere(to do): an agreement to act on one's behalf. Such \"action on behalf of\" implies theauthorityto decide which, if any, action is appropriate.[1][2]Some agents are colloquially known asbots, fromrobot. They may be embodied, as when execution is paired with a robot body, or assoftwaresuch as a chatbot executing on acomputer, such as amobile device, e.g.Siri. Software agents may be autonomous or work together with other agents or people. Software agents interacting with people (e.g.chatbots,human-robot interactionenvironments) may possess human-like qualities such asnatural language understandingand speech, personality or embody humanoid form (seeAsimo). Related and derived concepts includeintelligent agents(in particular exhibiting some aspects ofartificial intelligence, such asreasoning),autonomous agents(capable of modifying the methods of achieving their objectives),distributedagents (being executed on physically distinct computers),multi-agent systems(distributed agents that work together to achieve an objective that could not be accomplished by a single agent acting alone), andmobile agents(agents that can relocate their execution onto different processors). The basic attributes of an autonomous software agent are that agents: are not strictly invoked for a task, but activate themselves, may reside in wait status on a host, perceiving context, may get to run status on a host upon starting conditions, do not require interaction of user, may invoke other tasks including communication. The concept of an agent provides a convenient and powerful way to describe a complex software entity that is capable of acting with a certain degree ofautonomyin order to accomplish tasks on behalf of its host. But unlike objects, which are defined in terms ofmethodsandattributes, an agent is defined in terms of its behavior.[3] Various authors have proposed different definitions of agents, these commonly include concepts such as: persistence: code is not executed on demand but runs continuously and decides for itself when it should perform some activity; autonomy:agents have capabilities of task selection, prioritization, goal-directed behavior, decision-making without human intervention; social ability:agents are able to engage other components through some sort of communication and coordination, they may collaborate on a task; reactivity:agents perceive the context in which they operate and react to it appropriately. All agents are programs, but not all programs are agents. Contrasting the term with related concepts may help clarify its meaning. Franklin & Graesser (1997)[4]discuss four key notions that distinguish agents from arbitrary programs: reaction to the environment, autonomy, goal-orientation andpersistence. Agents are more autonomous thanobjects. Agents have flexible behavior:reactive,proactive, social. Agents have at least onethreadof control but may have more.[5] Expert systemsare not coupled to their environment. Expert systems are not designed for reactive, proactive behavior. Expert systems do not consider social ability.[5] Intelligent agents(also known asrational agents) are not just computer programs: they may also be machines, human beings, communities of human beings (such asfirms) or anything that is capable of goal-directed behavior. Software agents may offer various benefits to their end users by automating complex or repetitive tasks.[6]However, there are organizational and cultural impacts of this technology that need to be considered prior to implementing software agents. People like to perform easy tasks providing the sensation of success unless the repetition of the simple tasking is affecting the overall output. In general implementing software agents to perform administrative requirements provides a substantial increase in work contentment, as administering their own work does never please the worker. The effort freed up serves for a higher degree of engagement in the substantial tasks of individual work. Hence, software agents may provide the basics to implement self-controlled work, relieved from hierarchical controls and interference.[7]Such conditions may be secured by application of software agents for required formal support. The cultural effects of the implementation of software agents include trust affliction, skills erosion, privacy attrition and social detachment. Some users may not feel entirely comfortable fully delegating important tasks to software applications. Those who start relying solely on intelligent agents may lose important skills, for example, relating to information literacy. In order to act on a user's behalf, a software agent needs to have a complete understanding of a user's profile, including his/her personal preferences. This, in turn, may lead to unpredictable privacy issues. When users start relying on their software agents more, especially for communication activities, they may lose contact with other human users and look at the world with the eyes of their agents. These consequences are what agent researchers and users must consider when dealing with intelligent agent technologies.[8] The concept of an agent can be traced back toHewitt's Actor Model(Hewitt, 1977) - \"A self-contained, interactive and concurrently-executing object, possessing internal state and communication capability.\"[citation needed] To be more academic, software agent systems are a direct evolution of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). MAS evolved fromDistributed Artificial Intelligence(DAI), Distributed Problem Solving (DPS) and Parallel AI (PAI), thus inheriting all characteristics (good and bad) from DAI andAI. John Sculley's 1987 \"Knowledge Navigator\" video portrayed an image of a relationship between end-users and agents. Being an ideal first, this field experienced a series of unsuccessful top-down implementations, instead of a piece-by-piece, bottom-up approach. The range of agent types is now (from 1990) broad: WWW, search engines, etc. Buyer agents[9]travel around a network (e.g. the internet) retrieving information about goods and services. These agents, also known as 'shopping bots', work very efficiently for commodity products such as CDs, books, electronic components, and other one-size-fits-all products. Buyer agents are typically optimized to allow for digital payment services used in e-commerce and traditional businesses.[10] User agents, or personal agents, are intelligent agents that take action on your behalf. In this category belong those intelligent agents that already perform, or will shortly perform, the following tasks: Check your e-mail, sort it according to the user's order of preference, and alert you when important emails arrive. Play computer games as your opponent or patrol game areas for you. Assemble customized news reports for you. There are several versions of these, including CNN. Find information for you on the subject of your choice. Fill out forms on the Web automatically for you, storing your information for future reference Scan Web pages looking for and highlighting text that constitutes the \"important\" part of the information there Discuss topics with you ranging from your deepest fears to sports Facilitate with online job search duties by scanning known job boards and sending the resume to opportunities who meet the desired criteria Profile synchronization across heterogeneous social networks Monitoring and surveillance agentsare used to observe and report on equipment, usually computer systems. The agents may keep track of company inventory levels, observe competitors' prices and relay them back to the company, watchstock manipulationbyinsider tradingand rumors, etc. For example, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has an agent that monitors inventory, planning, schedules equipment orders to keep costs down, and manages food storage facilities. These agents usually monitor complex computer networks that can keep track of the configuration of each computer connected to the network. A special case of Monitoring-and-Surveillance agents are organizations of agents used to emulate the Human Decision-Making process during tactical operations. The agents monitor the status of assets (ammunition, weapons available, platforms for transport, etc.) and receive Goals (Missions) from higher level agents. The Agents then pursue the Goals with the Assets at hand, minimizing expenditure of the Assets while maximizing Goal Attainment. (See Popplewell, \"Agents and Applicability\") This agent uses information technology to find trends and patterns in an abundance of information from many different sources. The user can sort through this information in order to find whatever information they are seeking. A data mining agent operates in a data warehouse discovering information. A 'data warehouse' brings together information from many different sources. \"Data mining\" is the process of looking through the data warehouse to find information that you can use to take action, such as ways to increase sales or keep customers who are considering defecting. 'Classification' is one of the most common types of data mining, which finds patterns in information and categorizes them into different classes. Data mining agents can also detect major shifts in trends or a key indicator and can detect the presence of new information and alert you to it. For example, the agent may detect a decline in the construction industry for an economy; based on this relayed information construction companies will be able to make intelligent decisions regarding the hiring/firing of employees or the purchase/lease of equipment in order to best suit their firm. Some other examples of currentintelligent agentsinclude somespamfilters, gamebots, and server monitoring tools.Search engine indexingbots also qualify as intelligent agents. User agent- for browsing the World Wide Web Mail transfer agent- For serving E-mail, such asMicrosoft Outlook. Why? It communicates with the POP3 mail server, without users having to understandPOP3command protocols. It even has rule sets that filter mail for the user, thus sparing them the trouble of having to do it themselves.

Use of autonomous agents (deliberately equipped with noise) to optimize coordination in groups online.[11] Software bots are becoming important in software engineering.[12] Agents are also used in software security application to intercept, examine and act on various types of content.  Example include: Data Loss Prevention (DLP)Agents[13]- examine user operations on a computer or network, compare with policies specifying allowed actions, and take appropriate action (e.g. allow, alert, block).  The more comprehensive DLP agents can also be used to perform EDR functions. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Agents - monitor all activity on an endpoint computer in order to detect and respond to malicious activities Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) Agents - similar to DLP Agents, however examining traffic going to cloud applications Issues to consider in the development of agent-based systems include how tasks are scheduled and how synchronization of tasks is achieved how tasks are prioritized by agents how agents can collaborate, or recruit resources, how agents can be re-instantiated in different environments, and how their internal state can be stored, how the environment will be probed and how a change of environment leads to behavioral changes of the agents how messaging and communication can be achieved, what hierarchies of agents are useful (e.g. task execution agents, scheduling agents, resource providers ...). For software agents to work together efficiently they must sharesemanticsof their data elements. This can be done by having computer systems publish theirmetadata. The definition ofagent processingcan be approached from two interrelated directions: internal state processing and ontologies for representing knowledge interaction protocols– standards for specifying communication of tasks Agent systems are used to model real-world systems withconcurrencyor parallel processing. Agent Machinery – Engines of various kinds, which support the varying degrees of intelligence Agent Content – Data employed by the machinery in Reasoning and Learning Agent Access – Methods to enable the machinery to perceive content and perform actions as outcomes of Reasoning Agent Security – Concerns related to distributed computing, augmented by a few special concerns related to agents The agent uses its access methods to go out into local and remote databases to forage for content. These access methods may include setting up news stream delivery to the agent, or retrieval from bulletin boards, or using a spider to walk the Web. The content that is retrieved in this way is probably already partially filtered – by the selection of the newsfeed or the databases that are searched. The agent next may use its detailed searching or language-processing machinery to extract keywords or signatures from the body of the content that has been received or retrieved. This abstracted content (or event) is then passed to the agent's Reasoning or inferencing machinery in order to decide what to do with the new content. This process combines the event content with the rule-based or knowledge content provided by the user. If this process finds a good hit or match in the new content, the agent may use another piece of its machinery to do a more detailed search on the content. Finally, the agent may decide to take an action based on the new content; for example, to notify the user that an important event has occurred. This action is verified by a security function and then given the authority of the user. The agent makes use of a user-access method to deliver that message to the user. If the user confirms that the event is important by acting quickly on the notification, the agent may also employ its learning machinery to increase its weighting for this kind of event. Bots can act on behalf of their creators to do good as well as bad. There are a few ways which bots can be created to demonstrate that they are designed with the best intention and are not built to do harm. This is first done by having a bot identify itself in the user-agent HTTP header when communicating with a site. The source IP address must also be validated to establish itself as legitimate. Next, the bot must also always respect a site's robots.txt file since it has become the standard across most of the web. And like respecting the robots.txt file, bots should shy away from being too aggressive and respect any crawl delay instructions.[14] DAML(DARPA Agent Markup Language) 3APL(Artificial Autonomous Agents Programming Language) GOAL agent programming language Open Agent Architecture(OAA) Web Ontology Language(OWL) daemonsinUnix-likesystems.

In traditionalworkflowautomationtools, asoftware developerproduces a list of actions to automate a task and interface to theback endsystem using internalapplication programming interfaces(APIs) or dedicatedscripting language. In contrast, RPA systems develop the action list by watching the user perform that task in the application'sgraphical user interface(GUI), and then perform the automation by repeating those tasks directly in the GUI. This can lower the barrier to the use of automation in products that might not otherwise feature APIs for this purpose. RPA tools have strong technical similarities tographical user interface testingtools. These tools also automate interactions with theGUI, and often do so byrepeating a set of demonstration actionsperformed by a user. RPA tools differ from such systems in that they allow data to be handled in and between multiple applications, for instance, receivingemailcontaining an invoice, extracting the data, and then typing that into abookkeepingsystem. The typical benefits of robotic automation include reduced cost; increased speed, accuracy, and consistency; improved quality and scalability of production. Automation can also provide extra security, especially for sensitive data and financial services. As a form of automation, the concept has been around for a long time in the form ofscreen scraping, which can be traced back to early forms of malware[ambiguous]. However, RPA is much more extensible, consisting ofAPIintegration into other enterprise applications, connectors intoITSMsystems,terminal servicesand even some types of AI (e.g.machine learning) services such asimage recognition. It is considered to be a significant technological evolution in the sense that new software platforms are emerging which are sufficiently mature, resilient, scalable and reliable to make this approach viable for use in large enterprises[3](who would otherwise be reluctant due to perceived risks to quality and reputation). A principal barrier to the adoption of self-service is often technological: it may not always be feasible or economically viable to retrofit new interfaces onto existing systems. Moreover, organisations may wish to layer a variable and configurable set of process rules on top of the system interfaces which may vary according to market offerings and the type of customer. This only adds to the cost and complexity of the technological implementation. Robotic automation software provides a pragmatic means of deploying new services in this situation, where the robots simply mimic the behaviour of humans to perform the back-end transcription or processing. The relative affordability of this approach arises from the fact that no new IT transformation or investment is required; instead the software robots simply leverage greater use out of existing IT assets. The hosting of RPA services also aligns with the metaphor of a software robot, with each robotic instance having its own virtual workstation, much like a human worker. The robot uses keyboard and mouse controls to take actions and execute automations. Normally all of these actions take place in avirtual environmentand not on screen; the robot does not need a physical screen to operate, rather it interprets the screen display electronically. The scalability of modern solutions based on architectures such as these owes much to the advent ofvirtualizationtechnology, without which the scalability of large deployments would be limited by the available capacity to manage physical hardware and by the associated costs. The implementation of RPA in business enterprises has shown dramatic cost savings when compared to traditional non-RPA solutions.[4] There are however several risks with RPA. Criticism includes risks of stifling innovation and creating a more complex maintenance environment of existing software that now needs to consider the use of graphical user interfaces in a way they weren't intended to be used.[5] According toHarvard Business Review, most operations groups adopting RPA have promised their employees that automation would not result inlayoffs.[6]Instead, workers have been redeployed to do more interesting work. One academic study highlighted that knowledge workers did not feel threatened by automation: they embraced it and viewed the robots as team-mates.[7]The same study highlighted that, rather than resulting in a lower \"headcount\", the technology was deployed in such a way as to achieve more work and greater productivity with the same number of people. Conversely, however, some analysts proffer that RPA represents a threat to thebusiness process outsourcing(BPO) industry.[8]The thesis behind this notion is that RPA will enable enterprises to \"repatriate\" processes from offshore locations into local data centers, with the benefit of this new technology. The effect, if true, will be to create high-value jobs for skilled process designers in onshore locations (and within the associated supply chain of IT hardware, data center management, etc.) but to decrease the available opportunity to low-skilled workers offshore. On the other hand, this discussion appears to be healthy ground for debate as another academic study was at pains to counter the so-called \"myth\" that RPA will bring back many jobs from offshore.[7] Banking and finance process automation Mortgage and lending processes Customer care automation eCommerce merchandising operations Social media marketing Optical character recognitionapplications Data extractionprocess Fixed automation process[clarification needed] Academic studies[9][10]project that RPA, among other technological trends, is expected to drive a new wave of productivity and efficiency gains in the global labour market. Although not directly attributable to RPA alone,Oxford Universityconjectures that up to 35% of all jobs might be automated by 2035.[9] There are geographic implications to the trend in robotic automation. In the example above where an offshored process is \"repatriated\" under the control of the client organization (or even displaced by a business process outsourcer) from an offshore location to a data centre, the impact will be a deficit in economic activity to the offshore location and an economic benefit to the originating economy. On this basis, developed economies – with skills and technological infrastructure to develop and support a robotic automation capability – can be expected to achieve a net benefit from the trend. In aTEDxtalk[11]hosted byUniversity College London(UCL), entrepreneur David Moss explains that digital labour in the form of RPA is likely to revolutionize the cost model of the services industry by driving the price of products and services down, while simultaneously improving the quality of outcomes and creating increased opportunity for the personalization of services. In a separateTEDxin 2019 talk,[12]Japanese business executive, and former CIO of Barclays bank, Koichi Hasegawa noted that digital robots can be a positive effect on society if we start using a robot with empathy to help every person. He provides a case study of the Japanese insurance companies – Sompo Japan and Aioi – both of whom introduced bots to speed up the process of insurance pay-outs in past massive disaster incidents. Meanwhile, Professor Willcocks, author of the LSE paper[10]cited above, speaks of increased job satisfaction and intellectual stimulation, characterising the technology as having the ability to \"take the robot out of the human\",[13]a reference to the notion that robots will take over the mundane and repetitive portions of people's daily workload, leaving them to be used in more interpersonal roles or to concentrate on the remaining, more meaningful, portions of their day. It was also found in a 2021 study observing the effects of robotization inEuropethat, thegender pay gapincreased at a rate of .18% for every 1% increase in robotization of a given industry.[14] Unassisted RPA, orRPAAI,[15][16]is the next generation of RPA related technologies. Technological advancements around artificial intelligence allow a process to be run on a computer without needing input from a user. Hyperautomationis the application of advanced technologies like RPA, artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML) andprocess miningto augment workers and automate processes in ways that are significantly more impactful than traditional automation capabilities.[17][18][19]Hyperautomation is the combination of technologies that allow faster application authorship (like low-code and no-code) with automation technologies that coordinate different worker types (i.e. human and artificial) for intelligent and strategic workflow optimization.[20][21] Gartner's report notes that this trend was kicked off with robotic process automation (RPA). The report notes that, \"RPA alone is not hyperautomation. Hyperautomation requires a combination of tools to help support replicating pieces of where the human is involved in a task.\"[22] Back office clerical processes outsourced by large organisations - particularly those sent offshore - tend to be simple and transactional in nature, requiring little (if any) analysis or subjective judgement. This would seem to make an ideal starting point for organizations beginning to adopt robotic automation for the back office. Whether client organisations choose to take outsourced processes back \"in house\" from their business process outsourcing (BPO) providers, thus representing a threat to the future of the BPO business,[23]or whether the BPOs implement such automations on their clients' behalf may well depend on a number of factors. Conversely however, a BPO provider may seek to effect some form of client lock-in by means of automation. By removing cost from a business operation, where the BPO provider is considered to be the owner of the intellectual property and physical implementation of a robotic automation solution (perhaps in terms of hardware, ownership of software licences, etc.), the provider can make it very difficult for the client to take a process back \"in house\" or elect a new BPO provider. This effect occurs as the associated cost savings made through automation would - temporarily at least - have to be reintroduced to the business whilst the technical solution is reimplemented in the new operational context. The geographically agnostic nature of software means that new business opportunities may arise for those organisations that have a political or regulatory impediment to offshoring or outsourcing. A robotised automation can be hosted in a data centre in any jurisdiction and this has two major consequences for BPO providers. Firstly, for example, a sovereign government may not be willing or legally able to outsource the processing of tax affairs and security administration. On this basis, if robots are compared to a human workforce, this creates a genuinely new opportunity for a \"third sourcing\" option, after the choices of onshore vs. offshore. Secondly, and conversely, BPO providers have previously relocated outsourced operations to different political and geographic territories in response to changingwage inflationand newlabor arbitrageopportunities elsewhere. By contrast, a data centre solution would seem to offer a fixed and predictable cost base that, if sufficiently low in cost on a robot vs. human basis,  would seem to eliminate any potential need or desire to continually relocate operational bases. While robotic process automation has many benefits including cost efficiency and consistency in performance, it also has some limitations. Current RPA solutions demand continual technical support to handle system changes, therefore it lacks the ability to autonomously adapt to new conditions. Because of this limitation, the system sometimes needs manual reconfiguration, which in turn has an effect on efficiency.[24] RPA is based onautomotive technologyfollowing a predefined workflow, and artificial intelligence is data-driven and focuses on processing information to make predictions. Therefore there is a distinct difference between how the two systems operate. AI aims to mimic human intelligence, whereas RPA is focused on reproducing tasks that are typically human-directed.[25]Moreover, RPA could also be explained as virtual robots that take over routinized human work, it can identify data by interpreting the underlying tags. RPA, therefore, is based on machine learning, whereas AI utilizesself-learning technologies.[26] Voice recognitionanddigital dictationsoftware linked to join up business processes for straight through processing without manual intervention Specialisedremote infrastructure managementsoftware featuring automated investigation and resolution of problems, using robots for the first lineIT support Chatbotsused by internet retailers and service providers to service customer requests for information.

Such chatbots often usedeep learningandnatural language processing, but simpler chatbots have existed for decades. Although chatbots have existed since the late 1960s, the fieldgained widespread attention in the early 2020sdue to the popularity ofOpenAI'sChatGPT,[5][6]followed by alternatives such asMicrosoft'sCopilotandGoogle'sGemini.[7]Such examples reflect the recent practice of basing such products upon broadfoundationallarge language models, such asGPT-4or theGemini language model, that getfine-tunedso as to target specific tasks or applications (i.e., simulating human conversation, in the case of chatbots). Chatbots can also be designed or customized to further target even more specific situations and/or particular subject-matter domains.[8] A major area where chatbots have long been used is incustomer serviceandsupport, with various sorts ofvirtual assistants.[9]Companies spanning a wide range of industries have begun using the latestgenerative artificial intelligencetechnologies to power more advanced developments in such areas.[8] As chatbots work bypredictingresponses rather thanknowingthe meaning of their responses, this means they can produce coherent-sounding but inaccurate or fabricated content, referred to as ‘hallucinations’. When humans use and apply chatbot content contaminated with hallucinations, this results in ‘botshit’.[10]Given the increasing adoption and use of chatbots for generating content, there are concerns that this technology will significantly reduce the cost it takes humans to generate, spread and consume botshit.[11] In 1950,Alan Turing's famous article \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" was published,[12]which proposed what is now called theTuring testas a criterion ofintelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of acomputer programto impersonate a human in areal-timewritten conversation with a human judge to the extent that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably—on the basis of the conversational content alone—between the program and a real human. The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated great interest inJoseph Weizenbaum's programELIZA, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that they were conversing with a real human. However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and the introduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise: In artificial intelligence, machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the most experienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained, its magic crumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures. The observer says to himself \"I could have written that\". With that thought, he moves the program in question from the shelf marked \"intelligent\", to that reserved for curios. The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be \"explained\". Few programs ever needed it more.[13] ELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of clue words or phrases in the input, and the output of the corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in an apparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FAMILY').[13]Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merely superficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate because human judges are so ready to give the benefit of the doubt when conversational responses arecapable of being interpretedas \"intelligent\". Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational—even when it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching—can be exploited for useful purposes. Most people prefer to engage with programs that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicit information from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. Thus, for example, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentially providing a \"friendlier\" interface than a more formal search or menu system. This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbot technology from Weizenbaum's \"shelf ... reserved for curios\" to that marked \"genuinely useful computational methods\". Among the most notable early chatbots are ELIZA (1966) andPARRY(1972).[14][15][16][17]More recent notable programs includeA.L.I.C.E.,Jabberwackyand D.U.D.E (Agence Nationale de la RechercheandCNRS2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were used exclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include other functional features, such as games andweb searchingabilities. In 1984, a book calledThe Policeman's Beard is Half Constructedwas published, allegedly written by the chatbotRacter(though the program as released would not have been capable of doing so).[18] From 1978[19]to some time after 1983,[20]the CYRUS project led byJanet Kolodnerconstructed a chatbot simulatingCyrus Vance(57thUnited States Secretary of State). It usedcase-based reasoning, and updated its database daily by parsing wire news fromUnited Press International. The program was unable to process the news items subsequent to the surprise resignation of Cyrus Vance in April 1980, and the team constructed another chatbot simulating his successor,Edmund Muskie.[21][20] One pertinent field of AI research isnatural-language processing. Usually,weak AIfields employ specialized software or programming languages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses amarkup languagecalled AIML,[3]which is specific to its function as aconversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, so-called,Alicebots. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based onpattern matchingtechniques without any reasoning capabilities, the same technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would requiresapienceandlogical reasoningabilities. Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based onreal-timeuser interactions, rather than being driven from a staticdatabase. Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning withevolutionary algorithmsthat optimize their ability to communicate based on each conversation held. Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some software developers focus on the practical aspect,information retrieval. Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are theLoebner Prizeand The Chatterbox Challenge (the latter has been offline since 2015, however, materials can still be found from web archives).[22] Chatbots may useartificial neural networksas alanguage model. For example,generative pre-trained transformers(GPT), which use thetransformerarchitecture, have become common to build sophisticated chatbots. The \"pre-training\" in its name refers to the initial training process on a largetext corpus, which provides a solid foundation for the model to perform well on downstream tasks with limited amounts of task-specific data. An example of a GPT chatbot isChatGPT.[23]Despite criticism of its accuracy and tendency to “hallucinate”—that is, to confidently output false information and even cite non-existent sources—ChatGPT has gained attention for its detailed responses and historical knowledge. Another example is BioGPT, developed byMicrosoft, which focuses on answeringbiomedicalquestions.[24][25]In November 2023, Amazon announced a new chatbot, called Q, for people to use at work.[26] DBpediacreated a chatbot during theGSoCof 2017.[27][28][29]It can communicate throughFacebook Messenger(seeMaster of Code Globalarticle). Many companies' chatbots run onmessaging appsor simply viaSMS. They are used forB2Ccustomer service, sales and marketing.[30] In 2016, Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform. There were 30,000 bots created for Messenger in the first six months, rising to 100,000 by September 2017.[31] Since September 2017, this has also been as part of a pilot program on WhatsApp. AirlinesKLMandAeroméxicoboth announced their participation in the testing;[32][33][34][35]both airlines had previously launched customer services on the Facebook Messenger platform. The bots usually appear as one of the user's contacts, but can sometimes act as participants in agroup chat. Many banks, insurers, media companies, e-commerce companies, airlines, hotel chains, retailers, health care providers, government entities, and restaurant chains have used chatbots toanswer simple questions, increasecustomer engagement,[36]for promotion, and to offer additional ways to order from them.[37]Chatbots are also used inmarket researchto collect short survey responses.[38] A 2017 study showed 4% of companies used chatbots.[39]According to a 2016 study, 80% of businesses said they intended to have one by 2020.[40] Previous generations of chatbots were present on company websites, e.g. Ask Jenn fromAlaska Airlineswhich debuted in 2008[41]orExpedia's virtual customer service agent which launched in 2011.[41][42]The newer generation of chatbots includesIBM Watson-powered \"Rocky\", introduced in February 2017 by the New York City-basede-commercecompany Rare Carat to provide information to prospective diamond buyers.[43][44] Used by marketers to script sequences of messages, very similar to anautorespondersequence. Such sequences can be triggered by user opt-in or the use of keywords within user interactions. After a trigger occurs a sequence of messages is delivered until the next anticipated user response. Each user response is used in the decision tree to help the chatbot navigate the response sequences to deliver the correct response message. Other companies explore ways they can use chatbots internally, for example for Customer Support, Human Resources, or even inInternet-of-Things(IoT) projects.Overstock.com, for one, has reportedly launched a chatbot named Mila to automate certain simple yettime-consumingprocesses when requesting sick leave.[45]Other large companies such asLloyds Banking Group,Royal Bank of Scotland,RenaultandCitroënare now using automated online assistants instead ofcall centreswith humans to provide a first point of contact. ASaaSchatbot business ecosystem has been steadily growing since theF8Conference whenFacebook’sMark Zuckerbergunveiled that Messenger would allow chatbots into the app.[46]In large companies, like in hospitals and aviation organizations, IT architects are designing reference architectures for Intelligent Chatbots that are used to unlock and share knowledge and experience in the organization more efficiently, and reduce the errors in answers from expert service desks significantly.[47]These Intelligent Chatbots make use of all kinds of artificial intelligence like image moderation andnatural-language understanding(NLU),natural-language generation(NLG),machine learningand deep learning. Chatbots have great potential to serve as an alternate source for customer service.[48]Many high-tech banking organizations are looking to integrate automated AI-based solutions such as chatbots into their customer service in order to provide faster and cheaper assistance to their clients who are becoming increasingly comfortable with technology.  In particular, chatbots can efficiently conduct a dialogue, usually replacing other communication tools such as email, phone, orSMS. In banking, their major application is related to quick customer service answering common requests, as well as transactional support. Deep learningtechniques can be incorporated into chatbot applications to allow them to map conversations between users and customer service agents, especially in social media.[49]Research has shown that methods incorporating deep learning can learn writing styles from a brand and transfer them to another, promoting the brand's image on social media platforms.[49]Chatbots can create new ways of brands and user interactions, which can help improve the brand's performance and allow users to gain \"social, information, and economic benefits\".[49] Several studies report significant reduction in the cost of customer services, expected to lead to billions of dollars of economic savings in the next ten years.[50]In 2019,Gartnerpredicted that by 2021, 15% of all customer service interactions globally will be handled completely by AI.[51]A study by Juniper Research in 2019 estimates retail sales resulting from chatbot-based interactions will reach $112 billion by 2023.[52] Since 2016, when Facebook allowed businesses to deliver automated customer support, e-commerce guidance, content, and interactive experiences through chatbots, a large variety of chatbots were developed for the Facebook Messenger platform.[53] In 2016, Russia-based Tochka Bank launched the world's first Facebook bot for a range of financial services, including a possibility of making payments.[54] In July 2016,Barclays Africaalso launched a Facebook chatbot, making it the first bank to do so in Africa.[55] The France's third-largest bank by total assets[56]Société Généralelaunched their chatbot called SoBot in March 2018. While 80% of users of the SoBot expressed their satisfaction after having tested it, Société Générale deputy director Bertrand Cozzarolo stated that it will never replace the expertise provided by a human advisor.[57] The advantages of using chatbots for customer interactions in banking include cost reduction, financial advice, and 24/7 support.[58][59] Chatbots are also appearing in the healthcare industry.[60][61]A study suggested that physicians in the United States believed that chatbots would be most beneficial for scheduling doctor appointments, locating health clinics, or providing medication information.[62] The GPT chatbotChatGPTis able to answer user queries related to health promotion and disease prevention such as screening andvaccination.[63]Whatsapphas teamed up with theWorld Health Organization(WHO) to make a chatbot service that answers users' questions onCOVID-19.[64] In 2020,The Indian Governmentlaunched a chatbot called MyGov Corona Helpdesk,[65]that worked through Whatsapp and helped people access information about the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.[66][67] Certain patient groups are still reluctant to use chatbots. A mixed-methods study showed that people are still hesitant to use chatbots for their healthcare due to poor understanding of the technological complexity, the lack of empathy, and concerns about cyber-security.[68]The analysis showed that while 6% had heard of a health chatbot and 3% had experience of using it, 67% perceived themselves as likely to use one within 12 months. The majority of participants would use a health chatbot for seeking general health information (78%), booking a medical appointment (78%), and looking for local health services (80%). However, a health chatbot was perceived as less suitable for seeking results of medical tests and seeking specialist advice such as sexual health. The analysis of attitudinal variables showed that most participants reported their preference for discussing their health with doctors (73%) and having access to reliable and accurate health information (93%). While 80% were curious about new technologies that could improve their health, 66% reported only seeking a doctor when experiencing a health problem and 65% thought that a chatbot was a good idea. 30% reported dislike about talking to computers, 41% felt it would be strange to discuss health matters with a chatbot and about half were unsure if they could trust the advice given by a chatbot. Therefore, perceived trustworthiness, individual attitudes towards bots, and dislike for talking to computers are the main barriers to health chatbots.[63] In New Zealand, the chatbot SAM – short forSemantic Analysis Machine[69](made by Nick Gerritsen of Touchtech[70]) – has been developed. It is designed to share its political thoughts, for example on topics such as climate change, healthcare and education, etc. It talks to people through Facebook Messenger.[71][72][73][74] In 2022, the chatbot \"Leader Lars\" or \"Leder Lars\" was nominated forThe Synthetic Partyto run in theDanishparliamentary election,[75]and was built by the artist collective Computer Lars.[76]Leader Lars differed from earlier virtual politicians by leading apolitical partyand by not pretending to be an objective candidate.[77]This chatbot engaged in critical discussions on politics with users from around the world.[78] InIndia, the state government has launched a chatbot for its Aaple Sarkar platform,[79]which provides conversational access to information regarding public services managed.[80][81] Chatbots have been used at different levels of government departments, including local, national and regional contexts. Chatbots are used to provide services like citizenship and immigration, court administrations, financial aid, and migrants’ rights inquiries. For example, EMMA answers more than 500,000 inquiries monthly, regarding services on citizenship and immigration in the US.[82] Chatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing, such as toys.[83] HelloBarbieis an Internet-connected version of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company ToyTalk,[84]which previously used the chatbot for a range of smartphone-based characters for children.[85]These characters' behaviors are constrained by a set of rules that in effect emulate a particular character and produce a storyline.[86] TheMy Friend Cayladoll was marketed as a line of 18-inch (46 cm) dolls which usesspeech recognitiontechnology in conjunction with anAndroidoriOSmobile app to recognize the child's speech and have a conversation. Like the Hello Barbie doll, it attracted controversy due to vulnerabilities with the doll'sBluetoothstack and its use of data collected from the child's speech. IBM'sWatson computerhas been used as the basis for chatbot-based educational toys for companies such asCogniToys,[83]intended to interact with children for educational purposes.[87] Malicious chatbots are frequently used to fillchat roomswith spam and advertisements by mimicking human behavior and conversations or to entice people into revealing personal information, such as bank account numbers. They were commonly found onYahoo! Messenger,Windows Live Messenger,AOL Instant Messengerand otherinstant messagingprotocols. There has also been a published report of a chatbot used in a fake personal ad on a dating service's website.[88] Tay, an AI chatbot designed to learn from previous interaction, caused major controversy due to it being targeted by internet trolls on Twitter. Soon after its launch, the bot was exploited, and with its \"repeat after me\" capability, it started releasing racist, sexist, and controversial responses to Twitter users.[89]This suggests that although the bot learned effectively from experience, adequate protection was not put in place to prevent misuse.[90] If a text-sendingalgorithmcan pass itself off as a human instead of a chatbot, its message would be more credible. Therefore, human-seeming chatbots with well-crafted online identities could start scattering fake news that seems plausible, for instance making false claims during an election. With enough chatbots, it might be even possible to achieve artificialsocial proof.[91][92] Data securityis one of the major concerns of chatbot technologies. Security threats and system vulnerabilities are weaknesses that are often exploited by malicious users. Storage of user data and past communication, that is highly valuable for training and development of chatbots, can also give rise to security threats.[93]Chatbots operating on third-party networks may be subject to various security issues if owners of the third-party applications have policies regarding user data that differ from those of the chatbot.[93]Security threats can be reduced or prevented by incorporating protective mechanisms. Userauthentication, chatEnd-to-end encryption, and self-destructing messages are some effective solutions to resist potential security threats.[93] The creation and implementation of chatbots is still a developing area, heavily related toartificial intelligenceandmachine learning, so the provided solutions, while possessing obvious advantages, have some important limitations in terms of functionalities and use cases. However, this is changing over time. The most common limitations are listed below:[94] As the input/output database is fixed and limited, chatbots can fail while dealing with an unsaved query.[59] A chatbot's efficiency highly depends on language processing and is limited because of irregularities, such as accents and mistakes. Chatbots are unable to deal with multiple questions at the same time and so conversation opportunities are limited.[94] Chatbots require a large amount of conversational data to train.  Generative models, which are based on deep learning algorithms to  generate new responses word by word based on user input, are usually trained on a large dataset of natural-language phrases.[3] Chatbots have difficulty managing non-linear conversations that must go back and forth on a topic with a user.[95] As it happens usually with technology-led changes in existing services, some consumers, more often than not from older generations, are uncomfortable with chatbots due to their limited understanding, making it obvious that their requests are being dealt with by machines.[94] Chatbots sometimes provide plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical answers. They can make up names, dates, historical events, and even simple math problems.[96] In 2023, US-basedNational Eating Disorders Associationreplaced its humanhelplinestaff with a chatbot but had to take it offline after users reported receiving harmful advice from it.[97][98][99] Chatbots are increasingly present in businesses and often are used to automate tasks that do not require skill-based talents. With customer service taking place via messaging apps as well as phone calls, there are growing numbers of use-cases where chatbot deployment gives organizations a clear return on investment.Call centerworkers may be particularly at risk from AI-driven chatbots.[100] Chatbot developers create, debug, and maintain applications that automate customer services or other communication processes. Their duties include reviewing and simplifying code when needed. They may also help companies implement bots in their operations. A study byForrester(June 2017) predicted that 25% of all jobs would be impacted by AI technologies by 2019.[101] Prompt engineering, the task of designing and refining prompts (inputs) leading to desired AI-generated responses has gained significant demand and popularity in recent years, with the advent of sophisticated models, notablyOpenAI's GPT series.

In a manner analogous to electricity or computers, AI serves as ageneral-purpose technologythat has numerous applications, includinglanguage translation,image recognition,decision-making,[1][2]credit scoringande-commerce. AI includes the development of machines which can perceive, understand, act and learn a scientific discipline.[3] A recommendation system predicts the rating or preference a user would give to an item.[4][5]Artificial intelligence recommendation systems are designed to offer suggestions based on previous behavior. These systems have been used by companies such asNetflix,Amazon,InstagramandYouTube, where they generate personalized playlists, product suggestions, and video recommendations.[6] Machine learning is also used inweb feedssuch as for determining which posts should show up in social media feeds.[7][8]Various types ofsocial media analysisalso make use of machine learning[9][10]and there is research into its use for (semi-)automated tagging/enhancement/correction ofonline misinformationand relatedfilter bubbles.[11][12][13] AI is used to target web advertisements to those most likely to click or engage in them. It is also used to increase time spent on a website by selecting attractive content for the viewer. It can predict or generalize the behavior of customers from theirdigital footprints.[14]BothAdSense[citation needed]andFacebook[15]use AI for advertising. Online gambling companies use AI to improve customer targeting.[16] Personality computingAI models add psychological targeting to more traditional social demographics or behavioral targeting.[17]AI has been used to customize shopping options and personalize offers.[18] Intelligent personal assistantsuse AI to understand many natural language requests in other ways than rudimentary commands. Common examples are Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, and a more recent AI, ChatGPT by OpenAI.[19] Bing Chathas used artificial intelligence as part of itssearch engine.[20] Machine learning can be used to fight against spam, scams, andphishing. It can scrutinize the contents of spam and phishing attacks to attempt to identify malicious elements.[21]Some models built via machine learning algorithms have over 90% accuracy in distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.[22]These models can be refined from new data and evolving spam tactics. Machine learning also analyzes traits such as sender behavior, email header information, and attachment types.[23] Speech translation technology attempts to convert one language's spoken words into another. This potentially reduces language barriers in global commerce and cross-cultural exchange by allowing speakers of various languages to communicate with one another.[24] AI has been used to automatically translate spoken language and textual content, in products such asMicrosoft Translator,Google TranslateandDeepL Translator.[25]Additionally, research and development are in progress to decode and conduct animal communication.[26][27] Meaning is conveyed not only by text, but also through usage and context (seesemanticsandpragmatics). As a result, the two primary categorization approaches for machine translations are statistical andneural machine translations(NMTs). The old method of performing translation was to use astatistical machine translation(SMT) methodology to forecast the best probable output with specific algorithms. However, with NMT, the approach employs dynamic algorithms to achieve better translations based on context.[28] AI has been used infacial recognition systems, with a 99% accuracy rate. Some examples are Apple'sFace IDand Android'sFace Unlock, which are used to secure mobile devices.[29] Image labeling has been used byGoogleto detect products in photos and to allow people to search based on a photo. Image labeling has also been demonstrated to generate speech to describe images to blind people.[30]Facebook'sDeepFaceidentifies human faces in digital images. Games have been a major application[relevant?]of AI's capabilities since the 1950s. In the 21st century, AIs have beaten human players in many games, includingchess(Deep Blue),Jeopardy!(Watson),[31]Go(AlphaGo),[32][33][34][35][36][37][38]poker(Pluribus[39]andCepheus),[40]E-sports(StarCraft),[41][42]andgeneral game playing(AlphaZero[43][44][45]andMuZero).[46][47][48][49]AI has replaced hand-coded algorithms in most chess programs.[50]Unlikegoorchess, poker is animperfect-informationgame, so a program that plays poker has to reason under uncertainty. The general game players work using feedback from the game system, without knowing the rules. AI for Goodis an ITU initiative supporting institutions employing AI to tackle some of the world's greatest economic and social challenges. For example, theUniversity of Southern Californialaunched the Center for Artificial Intelligence in Society, with the goal of using AI to address problems such as homelessness.Stanfordresearchers useAIto analyze satellite images to identify high poverty areas.[51] In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield.[52]Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes,[53]monitor soil moisture, operateagricultural robots, conductpredictive analytics,[54][55]classify livestock pig call emotions,[26]automategreenhouses,[56]detect diseases and pests,[57][58]and save water.[59] AI helps in achieving precise farming, which calls for the use of algorithims to analyze data retrieved from satellite imagery and on-site field sensors. It allows for optimization of resource usage and helps to make the right decisions regarding the kind of nutrients, water, and pesticides required to maximize yield.[60] Using machine learning models to monitor the health of crops and the soil. The models will be able to detect and predict diseases and pests in crops ahead of time to allow timely interventions.[61] There are automated machinery such as tractors and harvesters, which can operate autonomously with minimal human labor. With the use of AI many duties in the area are possible to be done with precision.[62] Cyber securitycompanies are adoptingneural networks,machine learning, andnatural language processingto improve their systems.[63] Applications of AI in cyber security include: Network protection: Machine learning improvesintrusion detection systemsby broadening the search beyond previously identified threats. Endpoint protection: Attacks such asransomwarecan be thwarted by learning typical malware behaviors.AI-related cyber security application cases vary in both benefit and complexity. Security features such as Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) and Extended Endpoint Detection and Response (XDR) offer significant benefits for businesses, but require significant integration and adaptation efforts.[64] AI-related cyber security application cases vary in both benefit and complexity. Security features such as Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) and Extended Endpoint Detection and Response (XDR) offer significant benefits for businesses, but require significant integration and adaptation efforts.[64] Application security: can help counterattacks such asserver-side request forgery,SQL injection,cross-site scripting, anddistributed denial-of-service.AI technology can also be utilized to improve system security and safeguard our privacy. Randrianasolo (2012) suggested a security system based on artificial intelligence that can recognize intrusions and adapt to perform better.[65]In order to improve cloud computing security, Sahil (2015) created a user profile system for the cloud environment with AI techniques.[66] AI technology can also be utilized to improve system security and safeguard our privacy. Randrianasolo (2012) suggested a security system based on artificial intelligence that can recognize intrusions and adapt to perform better.[65]In order to improve cloud computing security, Sahil (2015) created a user profile system for the cloud environment with AI techniques.[66] Suspect user behavior: Machine learning can identify fraud or compromised applications as they occur.[67] Google fraud czarShuman Ghosemajumderhas said that AI will be used to completely automate most cyber security operations over time.[68] AI elevates teaching, focusing on significant issues like the knowledge nexus and educational equality. The evolution of AI in education and technology should be used to improve human capabilities in relationships where they do not replace humans.UNESCOrecognizes the future of AI in education as an instrument to reach Sustainable Development Goal 4, called \"Inclusive and Equitable Quality Education.”[69] TheWorld Economic Forumalso stresses AI's contribution to students' overall improvement and transforming teaching into a more enjoyable process.[69] Personalized Learning AI driven tutoring systems, such as Khan Academy, Duolingo and Carnegie Learning are the forefoot of delivering personalized education.[70] These platforms leverage AI algorithms to analyze individual learning patterns, strengths, and weaknesses, enabling the customization of content to suit each student's pace and style of learning.[70] Administrative Efficiency In educational institutions, AI is increasingly used to automate routine tasks like attendance tracking, grading and marking, which allows educators to devote more time to interactive teaching and direct student engagement.[71] Furthermore, AI tools are employed to monitor student progress, analyze learning behaviors, and predict academic challenges, facilitating timely and proactive interventions for students who may be at risk of falling behind.[71] Ethical and Privacy Concerns Despite the benefits, the integration of AI in education raises significant ethical and privacy concerns, particularly regarding the handling of sensitive student data.[70] It is imperative that AI systems in education are designed and operated with a strong emphasis on transparency, security, and respect for privacy to maintain trust and uphold the integrity of educational practices.[70] Much regulation will be influenced by the AI Act, the world’s first comprehensive AI law.[72] Financial institutionshave long usedartificial neural networksystems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation. The use of AI inbankingbegan in 1987 whenSecurity Pacific National Banklaunched a fraud prevention taskforce to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards.[73]Kasisto and Moneystream use AI. Banks use AI to organize operations, for bookkeeping, investing in stocks, and managing properties. AI can react to changes when business is not taking place.[74]AI is used to combat fraudand financial crimes by monitoring behavioral patterns for anyabnormal changes or anomalies.[75][76][77] The use of AI in applications such as online trading and decision-making has changed major economic theories.[78]For example, AI-based buying and selling platforms estimate individualized demand and supply curves and thus enable individualized pricing. AI machines reduceinformation asymmetryin the market and thusmake markets more efficient.[79]The application of artificial intelligence in the financial industry can alleviate the financing constraints of non-state-owned enterprises. Especially for smaller and more innovative enterprises.[80] Algorithmic tradinginvolves the use of AI systems to make trading decisions at speeds orders of magnitude greater than any human is capable of, making millions of trades in a day without human intervention. Suchhigh-frequency tradingrepresents a fast-growing sector. Many banks, funds, and proprietary trading firms now have entire portfolios that are AI-managed.Automated trading systemsare typically used by large institutional investors but include smaller firms trading with their own AI systems.[81] Large financial institutions use AI to assist with their investment practices.BlackRock's AI engine,Aladdin, is used both within the company and by clients to help with investment decisions. Its functions include the use ofnatural language processingto analyze text such as news, broker reports, and social media feeds. It then gauges the sentiment on the companies mentioned and assigns a score. Banks such asUBSandDeutsche Bankuse SQREEM (Sequential Quantum Reduction and Extraction Model) to mine data to develop consumer profiles and match them withwealth managementproducts.[82] Online lenderUpstartuses machine learning forunderwriting.[83] ZestFinance's Zest Automated Machine Learning (ZAML) platform is used for credit underwriting. This platform uses machine learning to analyze data including purchase transactions and how a customer fills out a form to score borrowers. The platform is particularly useful to assign credit scores to those with limited credit histories.[84] AI makes continuous auditing possible. Potential benefits include reducing audit risk, increasing the level of assurance, and reducing audit duration.[85][quantify] Continuous auditing with AI allows a real-time monitoring and reporting of financial activities and providing businesses with timely insights that can lead to quick decision making.[86] AI software, such as LaundroGraph which uses contemporary suboptimal datasets, could be used foranti-money laundering(AML).[87][88]AI can be used to \"develop the AML pipeline into a robust, scalable solution with a reduced false positive rate and high adaptability\".[89]A study about deep learning for AML identified \"key challenges for researchers\" to have \"access to recent real transaction data and scarcity of labelled training data; and data being highly imbalanced\" and suggests future research should bring-out \"explainability,graph deep learningusingnatural language processing(NLP), unsupervised and reinforcement learning to handle lack oflabelled data; and joint research programs between theresearch communityand industry to benefit from domain knowledge and controlled access to data\".[90] Banks use machine learning (ML) to upgrade process monitoring and demonstrating the ability of  responding efficiently to evolving techniques.[91] Through ML and other methods, financial organizations can detect laundering operations and run compliance in an automated and very fast mode.[91] In the 1980s, AI started to become prominent in finance asexpert systemswere commercialized. For example, Dupont created 100 expert systems, which helped them to save almost $10 million per year.[92]One of the first systems was the Pro-trader expert system that predicted the 87-point drop in theDow Jones Industrial Averagein 1986. \"The major junctions of the system were to monitor premiums in the market, determine the optimum investment strategy, execute transactions when appropriate and modify the knowledge base through a learning mechanism.\"[93] One of the first expert systems to help with financial plans was PlanPowerm and Client Profiling System, created by Applied Expert Systems (APEX). It was launched in 1986. It helped create personal financial plans for people.[94] In the 1990s AI was applied tofraud detection. In 1993 FinCEN Artificial Intelligence System (FAIS) launched. It was able to review over 200,000 transactions per week and over two years it helped identify 400 potential cases ofmoney launderingequal to $1 billion.[95]These expert systems were later replaced by machine learning systems.[96] AI can enhance entrepreneurial activity and AI is one of the most dynamic areas for start-ups, with significant venture capital flowing into AI.[97] AIfacial recognition systemsare used formass surveillance, notably in China.[98][99]In 2019,Bengaluru, Indiadeployed AI-managed traffic signals. This system uses cameras to monitor traffic density and adjust signal timing based on the interval needed to clear traffic.[100] Various countries are deploying AI military applications.[101]The main applications enhancecommand and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability.[102]Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous andautonomous vehicles.[101]AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions,target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributedJoint Firesbetween networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams.[102]AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.[101] In 2023, theUnited States Department of Defensetested generative AI based on large language models to digitize and integrate data across the military.[103] In the2023 Israel–Hamas war, Israel used two AI systems to generate targets to strike: Habsora (translated: \"the gospel\") was used to compile a list of buildings to target, while \"Lavender\" produced a list of people. \"Lavender\" produced a list of 37,000 people to target.[104][105]The list of buildings to target included Gazan private homes of people that were suspected of affiliation to Hamas operatives. The combination of AI targeting technology with policy shift away from avoiding civilian targets resulted in unprecedented numbers of civilian deaths.IDFofficials say the program addresses the previous issue of the air force running out of targets. Using Habsora, officials say that suspected and junior Hamas members homes significantly expand the \"AI target bank.\" An internal source describes the process as a “mass assassination factory”.[106][105] In 2024, the U.S. military trained artificial intelligence to identifyairstriketargets during its operations in Iraq and Syria.[107] In 2024 a Chinese laboratory at the Joint Operations College of the National Defense University inShijiazhuanghas created an AI military commander, for use in large-scalewar simulationsin the role of thecommander-in-chief.[108] Worldwide annual military spending on robotics rose from US$5.1 billion in 2010 to US$7.5 billion in 2015.[109][110]Military drones capable of autonomous action are in wide use.[111]The Ukrainian Army has developed 2024 autonomousKamikazedronesin oder to make Russian interference during flight ineffective.[112]Many researchers avoid military applications.[102] AI in healthcare is often used for classification, to evaluate aCT scanorelectrocardiogramor to identify high-risk patients for population health. AI is helping with the high-cost problem of dosing. One study suggested that AI could save $16 billion. In 2016, a study reported that an AI-derived formula derived the proper dose of immunosuppressant drugs to give to transplant patients.[113]Current research has indicated that non-cardiac vascular illnesses are also being treated with artificial intelligence (AI). For certain disorders, AI algorithms can assist with diagnosis, recommended treatments, outcome prediction, and patient progress tracking. As AI technology advances, it is anticipated that it will become more significant in the healthcare industry.[114] The early detection of diseases like cancer is made possible by AI algorithms, which diagnose diseases by analyzing complex sets of medical data. For example, the IBM Watson system might be used to comb through massive data such as medical records and clinical trials to help diagnose a problem.[115]Microsoft's AI project Hanover helps doctors choosecancer treatmentsfrom among the more than 800 medicines and vaccines.[116][117]Its goal is to memorize all the relevant papers to predict which (combinations of) drugs will be most effective for each patient.Myeloid leukemiais one target. Another study reported on an AI that was as good as doctors in identifying skin cancers.[118]Another project monitors multiple high-risk patients by asking each patient questions based on data acquired from doctor/patient interactions.[119]In one study done withtransfer learning, an AI diagnosed eye conditions similar to anophthalmologistand recommended treatment referrals.[120] Another study demonstrated surgery with an autonomous robot. The team supervised the robot while it performed soft-tissue surgery, stitching together a pig's bowel judged better than a surgeon.[121] Artificial neural networksare used asclinical decision support systemsfor medical diagnosis,[122]such as inconcept processingtechnology inEMRsoftware. Other healthcare tasks thought suitable for an AI that are in development include: Screening[123] Heart soundanalysis[124] Companion robots forelder care[125] Medical record analysis Treatment plan design[citation needed] Medication management Assisting blind people[126] Consultations[citation needed] Drug creation[127](e.g. by identifying candidate drugs[128]and by using existing drug screening data such as inlife extensionresearch)[129] Clinical training[130] Outcome prediction for surgical procedures HIV prognosis Identifying genomic pathogen signatures of novel pathogens[131]or identifying pathogens via physics-based fingerprints[132](including pandemic pathogens) Helping link genes to their functions,[133]otherwise analyzing genes[134]and identification of novel biological targets[135] Help development ofbiomarkers[135] Help tailor therapies to individuals inpersonalized medicine/precision medicine[135][136][137] AI-enabledchatbotsdecrease the need for humans to perform basic call center tasks.[138] Machine learning insentiment analysiscan spot fatigue in order to preventoverwork.[138]Similarly,decision support systemscan preventindustrial disastersand makedisaster responsemore efficient.[139]For manual workers inmaterial handling,predictive analyticsmay be used to reducemusculoskeletal injury.[140]Data collected fromwearable sensorscan improveworkplace health surveillance,risk assessment, and research.[139][how?] AI can auto-codeworkers' compensationclaims.[141][142]AI-enabledvirtual realitysystems can enhance safety training for hazard recognition.[139]AI can more efficiently detect accidentnear misses, which are important in reducing accident rates, but are often underreported.[143] AlphaFold 2can determine the 3D structure of a (folded) protein in hours rather than the months required by earlier automated approaches and was used to provide the likely structures of all proteins in the human body and essentially all proteins known to science (more than 200 million).[144][145][146][147] Machine learning has been used fordrug design.[148]It has also been used for predicting molecular properties and exploring large chemical/reaction spaces.[149]Computer-planned syntheses via computational reaction networks, described as a platform that combines \"computational synthesis with AI algorithms to predict molecular properties\",[150]have been used to explore theorigins of life on Earth,[151]drug-syntheses and developing routes forrecycling200 industrialwaste chemicalsinto important drugs and agrochemicals (chemical synthesis design).[152]There is research about which types of computer-aided chemistry would benefit from machine learning.[153]It can also be used for \"drug discoveryand development,drug repurposing, improving pharmaceutical productivity, and clinical trials\".[154]It has been used for thedesign of proteinswith prespecified functional sites.[155][156] It has been used with databases for the development of a 46-day process to design, synthesize and test a drug which inhibits enzymes of a particular gene,DDR1. DDR1 is involved in cancers and fibrosis which is one reason for the high-quality datasets that enabled these results.[157] There are various types of applications for machine learning in decoding human biology, such as helping to mapgene expressionpatterns to functional activation patterns[158]or identifying functionalDNA motifs.[159]It is widely used in genetic research.[160] There also is some use of machine learning insynthetic biology,[161][162]disease biology,[162]nanotechnology (e.g. nanostructured materials andbionanotechnology),[163][164]andmaterials science.[165][166][167] There are alsoprototype robot scientists, including robot-embodied ones like the twoRobot Scientists, which show a form of \"machine learning\" not commonly associated with the term.[168][169] Similarly, there is research and development of biological \"wetware computers\" that can learn (e.g. for use asbiosensors) and/or implantation into an organism's body (e.g. for use to control prosthetics).[170][171][172]Polymer-based artificial neurons operate directly in biological environments and define biohybrid neurons made of artificial and living components.[173][174] Moreover, ifwhole brain emulationis possible via both scanning and replicating the, at least, bio-chemical brain – as premised in the form of digital replication inThe Age of Em, possibly usingphysical neural networks– that may have applications as or more extensive than e.g. valued human activities and may imply that society would face substantial moral choices, societal risks and ethical problems[175][176]such as whether (and how) such are built,sent through spaceand used compared to potentially competing e.g. potentially more synthetic and/or less human and/or non/less-sentient types of artificial/semi-artificial intelligence.[additional citation(s) needed]An alternative or additive approach to scanning are types of reverse engineering of the brain.[177][178] A subcategory of artificial intelligence is embodied,[179][180]some of which are mobile robotic systems that each consist of one or multiple robots that are able to learn in the physical world. However,biological computers, even if both highly artificial and intelligent, are typically distinguished from synthetic, often silicon-based, computers – they could however be combined or used for the design of either. Moreover, many tasks may be carried out inadequately by artificial intelligence even if its algorithms were transparent, understood, bias-free, apparently effective, and goal-aligned and its trained data sufficiently large andcleansed– such as in cases were the underlying or available metrics,valuesor data are inappropriate.Computer-aidedis a phrase used to describe human activities that make use of computing as tool in more comprehensive activities and systems such as AI for narrow tasks or making use of such without substantially relying on its results (see also:human-in-the-loop).[citation needed]A study described the biological as a limitation of AI with \"as long as the biological system cannot be understood, formalized, and imitated, we will not be able to develop technologies that can mimic it\" and that if it was understood this does not mean there being \"a technological solution to imitate natural intelligence\".[181]Technologies that integrate biology and are often AI-based includebiorobotics. Artificial intelligence is used inastronomyto analyze increasing amounts of available data[182][183]and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights\" for example for discoveringexoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects ingravitational wave astronomy.[184]It could also be used for activities in space such asspace exploration, including analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance,[185]and more autonomous operation.[186][187][188][183] In thesearch for extraterrestrial intelligence(SETI), machine learning has been used in attempts to identify artificially generatedelectromagnetic wavesin available data[189][190]– such as real-time observations[191]– and othertechnosignatures, e.g. viaanomaly detection.[192]Inufology, the SkyCAM-5 project headed by Prof. Hakan Kayal[193]and theGalileo Projectheaded by Prof.Avi Loebuse machine learning to detect and classify peculiar types of UFOs.[194][195][196][197][198]The Galileo Project also seeks to detect two further types of potential extraterrestrial technological signatures with the use of AI:'Oumuamua-likeinterstellar objects, and non-manmade artificial satellites.[199][200] Loeb has speculated that one type of technological equipment the project may detect could be \"AI astronauts\"[201]and in 2021 – in an opinion piece – that AI \"will\" \"supersede natural intelligence\",[202]whileMartin Reesstated that there \"may\" be more civilizations than thought with the \"majority of them\" being artificial.[203]In particular,mid/far future or non-human applicationsof artificial intelligence could include advanced forms ofartificial general intelligencethat engages inspace colonizationor more narrow spaceflight-specific types of AI. In contrast, there have been concerns in relation to potential AGI or AI capable ofembryo space colonization, or more generally natural intelligence-based space colonization, such as \"safety of encounters with an alien AI\",[204][205]suffering risks(or inverse goals),[206][207]moral license/responsibility in respect to colonization-effects,[208]or AI gone rogue (e.g. as portrayed with fictionalDavid8andHAL 9000). See also:space lawandspace ethics. Loeb has described the possibility of \"AI astronauts\" that engage in \"supervised evolution\" (see also:directed evolution,uplift,directed panspermiaandspace colonization).[209] It can also be used to produce datasets of spectral signatures of molecules that may be involved in the atmospheric production or consumption of particular chemicals – such asphosphine possibly detected on Venus– which could prevent miss assignments and, if accuracy is improved, be used in future detections and identifications of molecules on other planets.[210] In April 2024, theScientific Advice Mechanismto theEuropean Commissionpublished advice[211]including a comprehensive evidence review of the opportunities and challenges posed by artificial intelligence in scientific research. As benefits, the evidence review[212]highlighted: its role in accelerating research and innovation its capacity to automate workflows enhancing dissemination of scientific work As challenges: limitations and risks around transparency, reproducibility and interpretability poor performance (inaccuracy) risk of harm through misuse or unintended use societal concerns including the spread of misinformation and increasing inequalities Machine learning can help to restore and attribute ancient texts.[213]It can help to index texts for example to enable better and easier searching[214]and classification of fragments.[215] Artificial intelligence can also be used to investigate genomes to uncovergenetic history, such asinterbreeding between archaic and modern humansby which for example the past existence of aghost population, notNeanderthalorDenisovan, was inferred.[216] It can also be used for \"non-invasive and non-destructive access to internal structures of archaeological remains\".[217] Adeep learningsystem was reported to learn intuitive physics from visual data (of virtual 3D environments) based on anunpublishedapproach inspired by studies of visual cognition in infants.[218][219]Other researchers have developed a machine learning algorithm that could discover sets of basic variables of various physical systems and predict the systems' future dynamics from video recordings of their behavior.[220][221]In the future, it may be possible that such can be used to automate the discovery of physical laws of complex systems.[220] AI could be used for materials optimization and discovery such as the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure.[222][223][224] In November 2023, researchers atGoogle DeepMindandLawrence Berkeley National Laboratoryannounced that they had developed an AI system known as GNoME. This system has contributed tomaterials scienceby discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe. GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganiccrystal structures. The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%. The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through theMaterials Projectdatabase, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications. This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development. The use of AI and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds.[225][226][227] Machine learning is used in diverse types ofreverse engineering. For example, machine learning has been used to reverse engineer a composite material part, enabling unauthorized production of high quality parts,[228]and for quickly understanding the behavior ofmalware.[229][230][231]It can be used to reverse engineer artificial intelligence models.[232]It can also design components by engaging in a type of reverse engineering of not-yet existent virtual components such as inverse molecular design for particular desired functionality[233]orprotein designfor prespecified functional sites.[155][156]Biological network reverse engineering could model interactions in a human understandable way, e.g. bas on time series data of gene expression levels.[234] AI is a mainstay of law-related professions. Algorithms and machine learning do some tasks previously done by entry-level lawyers.[235]While its use is common, it is not expected to replace most work done by lawyers in the near future.[236] Theelectronic discoveryindustry uses machine learning to reduce manual searching.[237] Law enforcement has begun usingfacial recognition systems(FRS) to identify suspects from visual data. FRS results have proven to be more accurate when compared to eyewitness results. Furthermore, FRS has shown to have much a better ability to identify individuals when video clarity and visibility are low in comparison to human participants.[238] COMPASis a commercial system used byU.S. courtsto assess the likelihood ofrecidivism.[239] One concern relates toalgorithmic bias, AI programs may become biased after processing data that exhibits bias.[240]ProPublicaclaims that the average COMPAS-assigned recidivism risk level of black defendants is significantly higher than that of white defendants.[239] In 2019, the city ofHangzhou, China established a pilot program artificial intelligence-based Internet Court to adjudicate disputes related to ecommerce and internet-relatedintellectual propertyclaims.[241]: 124Parties appear before the court via videoconference and AI evaluates the evidence presented and applies relevant legal standards.[241]: 124 Another application of AI is in human resources. AI can screen resumes and rank candidates based on their qualifications, predict candidate success in given roles, and automate repetitive communication tasks via chatbots.[242] AI has simplified the recruiting /job search process for both recruiters and job seekers. According toRaj MukherjeefromIndeed, 65% of job searchers search again within 91 days after hire. An AI-powered engine streamlines the complexity of job hunting by assessing information on job skills, salaries, and user tendencies, matching job seekers to the most relevant positions. Machine intelligence calculates appropriate wages and highlights resume information for recruiters using NLP, which extracts relevant words and phrases from text. Another application is an AI resume builder that compiles a CV in 5 minutes.[243]Chatbotsassist website visitors and refine workflows. AI underliesavatars(automated online assistants) on web pages.[244]It can reduce operation and training costs.[244]Pypestreamautomated customer service for its mobile application to streamline communication with customers.[245] A Google app analyzes language and converts speech into text. The platform can identify angry customers through their language and respond appropriately.[246]Amazon uses a chatbot for customer service that can perform tasks like checking the status of an order, cancelling orders, offering refunds and connecting the customer with a human representative.[247]Generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, is increasingly used in business to automate tasks and enhance decision-making.[248] In the hospitality industry, AI is used to reduce repetitive tasks, analyze trends, interact with guests, and predict customer needs.[249]AI hotel services come in the form of a chatbot,[250]application, virtual voice assistant and service robots. AI applications analyze media content such as movies, TV programs, advertisement videos oruser-generated content. The solutions often involvecomputer vision. Typical scenarios include the analysis of images usingobject recognitionor face recognition techniques, or theanalysis of videofor scene recognizing scenes, objects or faces. AI-based media analysis can facilitate media search, the creation of descriptive keywords for content, content policy monitoring (such as verifying the suitability of content for a particular TV viewing time),speech to textfor archival or other purposes, and the detection of logos, products or celebrity faces for ad placement. Motion interpolation[251] Pixel-art scaling algorithms[252] Image scaling[253] Image restoration[254][255] Photo colorization[256] Film restorationand video upscaling[257] Photo tagging[258] Automated species identification(such as identifying plants, fungi and animals with an app) Text-to-image modelssuch asDALL-E,MidjourneyandStable Diffusion Image to video[259] Text to video such as Make-A-Video from Meta, Imagen video and Phenaki from Google Text to music with AI models such as MusicLM[260][261] Text to speech such asElevenLabsand15.ai Motion capture[262] Make image transparent[263] Deep-fakescan be used for comedic purposes but are better known forfake newsand hoaxes. In January 2016,[264]theHorizon 2020program financed the InVID Project[265][266]to help journalists and researchers detect fake documents, made available as browser plugins.[267][268] In June 2016, the visual computing group of theTechnical University of Munichand fromStanford Universitydeveloped Face2Face,[269]a program that animates photographs of faces, mimicking the facial expressions of another person. The technology has been demonstrated animating the faces of people includingBarack ObamaandVladimir Putin. Other methods have been demonstrated based ondeep neural networks, from which the namedeep fakewas taken. In September 2018, U.S. SenatorMark Warnerproposed to penalizesocial mediacompanies that allow sharing of deep-fake documents on their platforms.[270] In 2018, Darius Afchar and Vincent Nozick found a way to detect faked content by analyzing the mesoscopic properties of video frames.[271]DARPAgave 68 million dollars to work on deep-fake detection.[271] Audio deepfakes[272][273]and AI software capable of detecting deep-fakes and cloning human voices have been developed.[274][275] Respeecheris a program that enables one person to speak with the voice of another. AI algorithms have been used to detect deepfake videos.[276][277] Artificial Intelligenceis also starting to be used in video production, with tools and softwares being developed that utilize generative AI in order to create new video, or alter existing video. Some of the major tools that are being used in these processes currently are DALL-E, Mid-journey, and Runway.[278]Way mark Studios utilized the tools offered by bothDALL-EandMid-journeyto create a fully AI generated film calledThe Frostin the summer of 2023.[278]Way mark Studios is experimenting with using these AI tools to generate advertisements and commercials for companies in mere seconds.[278]Yves Bergquist, a director of the AI &Neurosciencein Media Project at USC's Entertainment Technology Center, says post production crews in Hollywood are already using generative AI, and predicts that in the future more companies will embrace this new technology.[279] AI has been used to compose music of various genres. David Copecreated an AI calledEmily Howellthat managed to become well known in the field of algorithmic computer music.[280]The algorithm behind Emily Howell is registered as a US patent.[281] In 2012, AIIamuscreated the first complete classical album.[282] AIVA(Artificial Intelligence Virtual Artist), composes symphonic music, mainlyclassical musicforfilm scores.[283]It achieved a world first by becoming the first virtual composer to be recognized by a musicalprofessional association.[284] Melomicscreates computer-generated music for stress and pain relief.[285] At Sony CSL Research Laboratory, the Flow Machines software creates pop songs by learning music styles from a huge database of songs. It can compose in multiple styles. The Watson Beat usesreinforcement learninganddeep belief networksto compose music on a simple seed input melody and a select style. The software was open sourced[286]and musicians such asTaryn Southern[287]collaborated with the project to create music. South Korean singer Hayeon's debut song, \"Eyes on You\" was composed using AI which was supervised by real composers, including NUVO.[288] Narrative Sciencesellscomputer-generated newsand reports. It summarizes sporting events based on statistical data from the game. It also creates financial reports and real estate analyses.[289]Automated Insightsgenerates personalized recaps and previews forYahoo SportsFantasy Football.[290] Yseop, uses AI to turn structured data into natural language comments and recommendations.Yseopwrites financial reports, executive summaries, personalized sales or marketing documents and more in multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, and German.[291] TALESPIN made up stories similar to thefables of Aesop. The program started with a set of characters who wanted to achieve certain goals. The story narrated their attempts to satisfy these goals.[citation needed]Mark Riedl and Vadim Bulitko asserted that the essence of storytelling was experience management, or \"how to balance the need for a coherent story progression with user agency, which is often at odds\".[292] While AI storytelling focuses on story generation (character and plot), story communication also received attention. In 2002, researchers developed an architectural framework for narrative prose generation. They faithfully reproduced text variety and complexity on stories such asLittle Red Riding Hood.[293]In 2016, a Japanese AI co-wrote a short story and almost won a literary prize.[294] South Korean company Hanteo Global uses a journalism bot to write articles.[295] Literary authors are also exploring uses of AI. An example isDavid Jhave Johnston's workReRites(2017-2019), where the poet created a daily rite of editing the poetic output of a neural network to create a series of performances and publications. In 2010, artificial intelligence usedbaseballstatistics to automatically generate news articles. This was launched byThe Big Ten Networkusing a software fromNarrative Science.[296] After being unable to cover everyMinor League Baseballgame with a large team of people,Associated Presscollaborated withAutomated Insightsin 2016 to create game recaps that were automated by artificial intelligence.[297] UOLin Brazil expanded the use of AI in their writing. Rather than just generating news stories, they programmed the AI to include commonly searched words onGoogle.[297] El Pais, a Spanish news site that covers many things including sports, allows users to make comments on each news article. They use thePerspective APIto moderate these comments and if the software deems a comment to contain toxic language, the commenter will be forced to change their comment in order to publish it.[297] A local Dutch media group used AI to create automatic coverage of amateur soccer, set to cover 60,000 games in just a single season. NDC partnered with United Robots to create this algorithm and cover what would have never been able to be done before without an extremely large team.[297] Lede AI has been used in 2023 to take scores fromhigh school footballgames to generate stories automatically for the local news paper. This was met with a lot of criticism from readers for the very robotic diction that was published. With some descriptions of games being a \"close encounter of the athletic kind,\" readers were not pleased and let the publishing company,Gannett, know on social media. Gannett has since halted their used of Lede AI until they come up with a solution for what they call an experiment.[298] Millions of its articles have been edited by bots[302]which however are usually not artificial intelligence software. Many AI platforms use Wikipedia data,[303]mainly for training machine learning applications. There is research and development of various artificial intelligence applications for Wikipedia such as for identifying outdated sentences,[304]detecting covert vandalism[305]or recommending articles and tasks to new editors. Machine translation(seeabove)has also be used for translating Wikipedia articles and could play a larger role in creating, updating, expanding, and generally improving articles in the future. A content translation tool allows editors of some Wikipedias to more easily translate articles across several select languages.[306][307] In video games, AI is routinely used to generate behavior innon-player characters(NPCs). In addition, AI is used forpathfinding. Some researchers consider NPC AI in games to be a \"solved problem\" for most production tasks.[who?]Games with less typical AI include the AI director ofLeft 4 Dead(2008) and the neuroevolutionary training of platoons inSupreme Commander 2(2010).[308][309]AI is also used inAlien Isolation(2014) as a way to control the actions the Alien will perform next.[310] Kinect, which provides a 3D body–motion interface for theXbox 360and theXbox One, uses algorithms that emerged from AI research.[311][which?] AI has been used to produce visual art. The first AI art program, calledAARON, was developed byHarold Cohenin 1968[312]with the goal of being able to code the act of drawing. It started by creating simple black and white drawings, and later to paint using special brushes and dyes that were chosen by the program itself without mediation from Cohen.[313] AI platforms such as \"DALL-E\",[314]Stable Diffusion,[314]Imagen,[315]andMidjourney[316]have been used for generating visual images from inputs such as text or other images.[317]Some AI tools allow users to input images and output changed versions of that image, such as to display an object or product in different environments. AI image models can also attempt to replicate the specific styles of artists, and can add visual complexity to rough sketches. Since their design in 2014,generative adversarial networks(GANs) have been used by AI artists. GAN computer programming, generates technical images through machine learning frameworks that surpass the need for human operators.[312]Examples of GAN programs that generate art includeArtbreederandDeepDream. In addition to the creation of original art, research methods that utilize AI have been generated to quantitatively analyze digital art collections. Although the main goal of the large-scale digitization of artwork in the past few decades was to allow for accessibility and exploration of these collections, the use of AI in analyzing them has brought about new research perspectives.[318]Two computational methods, close reading and distant viewing, are the typical approaches used to analyze digitized art.[319]While distant viewing includes the analysis of large collections, close reading involves one piece of artwork. AI has been in use since the early 2000s, most notably by a system designed by Pixar called \"Genesis\".[320]It was designed to learn algorithms and create 3D models for its characters and props. Notable movies that used this technology included Up and The Good Dinosaur.[321]AI has been used less ceremoniously in recent years. In 2023, it was revealed Netflix of Japan was using AI to generate background images for their upcoming show to be met with backlash online.[322]In recent years, motion capture became an easily accessible form of AI animation. For example, Move AI is a program built to capture any human movement and reanimate it in its animation program using learning AI.[323] Power electronicsconverters are used inrenewable energy,energy storage,electric vehiclesandhigh-voltage direct currenttransmission. These converters are failure-prone, which can interrupt service and require costly maintenance or catastrophic consequences in mission critical applications.[citation needed]AI can guide the design process for reliable power electronics converters, by calculating exact design parameters that ensure the required lifetime.[324] The U.S. Department of Energy underscores AI's pivotal role in realizing national climate goals. With AI, the ambitious target of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy becomes feasible. AI also helps make room for wind and solar on the grid by avoiding congestion and increasing grid reliability.[325] Machine learning can be used for energy consumption prediction and scheduling, e.g. to help withrenewable energy intermittency management(see also:smart gridandclimate change mitigation in the power grid).[326][327][328][329][148] Many telecommunications companies make use ofheuristic searchto manage their workforces. For example,BT Groupdeployed heuristic search[330]in an application that schedules 20,000 engineers. Machine learning is also used forspeech recognition(SR), including of voice-controlled devices, and SR-related transcription, including of videos.[331][332] Artificial intelligence has been combined with digitalspectrometryby IdeaCuria Inc.,[333][334]enable applications such as at-home water quality monitoring. In the 1990s early AIs controlledTamagotchisandGiga Pets, theInternet, and the first widely released robot,Furby.Aibowas adomestic robotin the form of a robotic dog with intelligent features andautonomy. Mattel created an assortment of AI-enabled toys that \"understand\" conversations, give intelligent responses, and learn.[335] Oil and gascompanies have used artificial intelligence tools to automate functions, foresee equipment issues, and increase oil and gas output.[336][337] AI in transport is expected to provide safe, efficient, and reliable transportation while minimizing the impact on the environment and communities. The major development challenge is the complexity of transportation systems that involves independent components and parties, with potentially conflicting objectives.[338] AI-basedfuzzy logiccontrollers operategearboxes. For example, the 2006Audi TT,VW Touareg[citation needed]andVW Caravellfeature the DSP transmission. A number of Škoda variants (Škoda Fabia) include a fuzzy logic-based controller. Cars have AI-baseddriver-assistfeatures such asself-parkingandadaptive cruise control. There are also prototypes of autonomous automotive public transport vehicles such as electric mini-buses[339][340][341][342]as well asautonomous rail transportinoperation.[343][344][345] There also are prototypes of autonomous delivery vehicles, sometimes includingdelivery robots.[346][347][348][349][350][351][352] Transportation's complexity means that in most cases training an AI in a real-world driving environment is impractical. Simulator-based testing can reduce the risks of on-road training.[353] AI underpins self-driving vehicles. Companies involved with AI includeTesla,Waymo, andGeneral Motors. AI-based systems control functions such as braking, lane changing, collision prevention, navigation and mapping.[354] Autonomous trucks are in the testing phase. The UK government passed legislation to begin testing of autonomous truck platoons in 2018.[355]A group of autonomous trucks follow closely behind each other. German corporationDaimleris testing itsFreightliner Inspiration.[356] Autonomous vehicles require accurate maps to be able to navigate between destinations.[357]Some autonomous vehicles do not allow human drivers (they have no steering wheels or pedals).[358] AI has been used to optimize traffic management, which reduces wait times, energy use, and emissions by as much as 25 percent.[359] Smart traffic lightshave been developed atCarnegie Mellonsince 2009.  Professor Stephen Smith has started a company since thenSurtracthat has installed smart traffic control systems in 22 cities.  It costs about $20,000 per intersection to install. Drive time has been reduced by 25% and traffic jam waiting time has been reduced by 40% at the intersections it has been installed.[360] TheRoyal Australian AirForce (RAAF)Air Operations Division(AOD) uses AI forexpert systems. AIs operate as surrogate operators for combat and training simulators, mission management aids, support systems for tactical decision making, and post processing of the simulator data into symbolic summaries.[361] Aircraft simulators use AI for training aviators. Flight conditions can be simulated that allow pilots to make mistakes without risking themselves or expensive aircraft. Air combat can also be simulated. AI can also be used to operate planes analogously to their control of ground vehicles. Autonomous drones can fly independently or inswarms.[362] AOD uses the Interactive Fault Diagnosis and Isolation System, or IFDIS, which is a rule-based expert system using information fromTF-30documents and expert advice from mechanics that work on the TF-30. This system was designed to be used for the development of the TF-30 for theF-111C. The system replaced specialized workers. The system allowed regular workers to communicate with the system and avoid mistakes, miscalculations, or having to speak to one of the specialized workers. Speech recognitionallows traffic controllers to give verbal directions to drones. Artificial intelligence supported design of aircraft,[363]or AIDA, is used to help designers in the process of creating conceptual designs of aircraft. This program allows the designers to focus more on the design itself and less on the design process. The software also allows the user to focus less on the software tools. The AIDA uses rule-based systems to compute its data. This is a diagram of the arrangement of the AIDA modules. Although simple, the program is proving effective. In 2003 aDryden Flight Research Centerproject created software that could enable a damaged aircraft to continue flight until a safe landing can be achieved.[364]The software compensated for damaged components by relying on the remaining undamaged components.[365] The 2016 Intelligent Autopilot System combinedapprenticeship learningand behavioral cloning whereby the autopilot observed low-level actions required to maneuver the airplane and high-level strategy used to apply those actions.[366] Neural networksare used bysituational awarenesssystems in ships and boats.[367]There also areautonomous boats. Autonomous ships that monitor the ocean, AI-driven satellite data analysis,passive acoustics[368]orremote sensingand other applications ofenvironmental monitoringmake use of machine learning.[369][370][371][188] For example, \"Global Plastic Watch\" is an AI-basedsatellite monitoring-platform for analysis/tracking ofplastic wastesites to helppreventionofplastic pollution– primarilyocean pollution– by helping identify who and where mismanages plastic waste, dumping it into oceans.[372][373] Machine learning can be used tospot early-warning signsof disasters and environmental issues, possibly including naturalpandemics,[374][375]earthquakes,[376][377][378]landslides,[379]heavy rainfall,[380]long-term water supply vulnerability,[381]tipping-points ofecosystem collapse,[382]cyanobacterial bloomoutbreaks,[383]and droughts.[384][385][386] AI can be used for real-time code completion, chat, and automated test generation. These tools are typically integrated with editors andIDEsasplugins. They differ in functionality, quality, speed, and approach to privacy.[387]Code suggestions could be incorrect, and should be carefully reviewed by software developers before accepted. GitHub Copilotis an artificial intelligence model developed byGitHubandOpenAIthat is able to autocomplete code in multiple programming languages.[388]Price for individuals: $10/mo or $100/yr, with one free month trial. Tabninewas created by Jacob Jackson and was originally owned by Tabnine company. In late 2019, Tabnine was acquired byCodota.[389]Tabnine tool is available aspluginto most popularIDEs. It offers multiple pricing options, including limited \"starter\" free version.[390] CodiumAIby CodiumAI, small startup in Tel Aviv, offers automated test creation. Currently supports Python, JS, and TS.[391] GhostwriterbyReplitoffers code completion and chat.[392]They have multiple pricing plans, including a free one and a \"Hacker\" plan for $7/month. CodeWhispererbyAmazoncollects individual users' content, including files open in the IDE. They claim to focus on security both during transmission and when storing.[393]Individual plan is free, professional plan is $19/user/month. Other tools: SourceGraph Cody, CodeCompleteFauxPilot, Tabby[387] AI can be used to create other AIs. For example, around November 2017, Google's AutoML project to evolve new neural net topologies createdNASNet, a system optimized forImageNetand POCO F1. NASNet's performance exceeded all previously published performance on ImageNet.[394] Machine learning has been used for noise-cancelling inquantum technology,[395]includingquantum sensors.[396]Moreover, there is substantial research and development of using quantum computers with machine learning algorithms. For example, there is a prototype, photonic,quantummemristive deviceforneuromorphic (quantum-)computers(NC)/artificial neural networksand NC-using quantum materials with some variety of potential neuromorphic computing-related applications,[397][398]andquantum machine learningis a field with some variety of applications under development. AI could be used forquantum simulatorswhich may have the application of solving physics andchemistry[399][400]problems as well as forquantum annealersfor training of neural networks for AI applications.[401]There may also be some usefulness in chemistry, e.g. for drug discovery, and in materials science, e.g. for materials optimization/discovery (with possible relevance to quantum materials manufacturing[223][224]).[402][403][404][better source needed] AI researchers have created many tools to solve the most difficult problems in computer science. Many of their inventions have been adopted by mainstream computer science and are no longer considered AI. All of the following were originally developed in AI laboratories:[405] Time sharing Interactive interpreters Graphical user interfacesand thecomputer mouse Rapid application developmentenvironments Thelinked listdata structure Automatic storage management Symbolic programming Functional programming Dynamic programming Object-oriented programming Optical character recognition Constraint satisfaction Anoptical character readeris used in the extraction of data in business documents like invoices and receipts. It can also be used in business contract documents e.g.employment agreementsto extract critical data like employment terms, delivery terms, termination clauses, etc.[406] Artificial intelligence in architecturedescribes the use ofartificial intelligencein automation, design and planning in the architectural process or in assisting human skills in the field of architecture.Artificial Intelligenceis thought to potentially lead to and ensue major changes in Architecture.[407][408][409] AI in architecture has created a way for architects to create things beyond human understanding. AI implementation of machine learning text-to-render technologies, like DALL-E and stable Diffusion, gives power to visualization complex.[410] AI allows designers to demonstrate their creativity and even invent new ideas while designing. In future, AI will not replace architects; instead, it will improve the speed of translating ideas sketching.[410] Optical character recognition Handwriting recognition Speech recognition Face recognition Generative artificial intelligence Synthetic media Artificial creativity Computer vision Virtual reality Image processing Photoandvideo manipulation Diagnosis (artificial intelligence) Game theoryandstrategic planning Game artificial intelligenceandcomputer game bot Natural language processing,translationandchatterbots Nonlinear controlandrobotics Chatbots and assistant apps like Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri Social bot To transcribe music Law related services Healthcare Education and Learning Disabilities related issues User activity monitoring, personalized targeted promotion and marketing via ads Humanoids Games like DeepBlue Agent-based modelsAgent-based computational economicsArtificial life Agent-based computational economics Artificial life Automated reasoningAutomated theorem provingProof assistants Automated theorem proving Proof assistants Automation Bio-inspired computing Concept mining Data mining Knowledge representation Semantic Web Email spamfiltering Filteringhate speech,nudity, and other unwanted content.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(robot)", "text": "Anandroidis ahumanoid robotor other artificial being often made from a flesh-like material.[1][2][3][4]Historically, androids existed only in the domain of science fiction and were frequently seen in film and television, but advances inrobot technologyhave allowed the design of functional and realistic humanoid robots.[5][6] TheOxford English Dictionarytraces the earliest use (as \"Androides\") toEphraim Chambers' 1728Cyclopaedia,in reference to anautomatonthat St.Albertus Magnusallegedly created.[3][7]By the late 1700s, \"androides\", elaborate mechanical devices resembling humans performing human activities, were displayed in exhibit halls.[8]The term \"android\" appears in US patents as early as 1863 in reference to miniature human-like toy automatons.[9]The termandroidwas used in a more modern sense by the French authorAuguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adamin his workTomorrow's Eve(1886), featuring an artificial humanoid robot named Hadaly.[3]The term made an impact into Englishpulp science fictionstarting fromJack Williamson'sThe Cometeers(1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized byEdmond Hamilton'sCaptain Futurestories (1940–1944).[3] AlthoughKarel Čapek's robots inR.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)(1921)—the play that introduced the wordrobotto the world—were organic artificial humans, the word \"robot\" has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.[3]The term \"android\" can mean either one of these,[3]while acyborg(\"cybernetic organism\" or \"bionic man\") would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts. The term \"droid\", popularized byGeorge Lucasin the originalStar Warsfilm and now used widely within science fiction, originated as an abridgment of \"android\", but has been used by Lucas and others to mean any robot, including distinctly non-human form machines likeR2-D2. The word \"android\" was used inStar Trek: The Original Seriesepisode \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\" The abbreviation \"andy\", coined as apejorativeby writerPhilip K. Dickin his novelDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, has seen some further usage, such as within the TV seriesTotal Recall 2070.[10] While the term \"android\" is used in reference to human-looking robots in general (not necessarily male-looking humanoid robots), a robot with a female appearance can also be referred to as agynoid. Besides one can refer to robots without alluding to their sexual appearance by calling themanthrobots(a portmanteau of anthrōpos and robot; seeanthrobotics) oranthropoids(short for anthropoid robots; the termhumanoidsis not appropriate because it is already commonly used to refer to human-like organic species in the context of science fiction, futurism and speculative astrobiology).[11] Authors have used the termandroidin more diverse ways thanrobotorcyborg. In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only superficial, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics.[3]In other stories, authors have used the word \"android\" to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.[3]Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.[3] Eric G. Wilson, who defines an android as a \"synthetic human being\", distinguishes between three types of android, based on their body's composition: the mummy type – made of \"dead things\" or \"stiff, inanimate, natural material\", such as mummies, puppets, dolls and statues the golem type – made from flexible, possibly organic material, including golems and homunculi the automaton type – made from a mix of dead and living parts, including automatons and robots[4] Although human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts:simulacra(devices that exhibit likeness) andautomata(devices that have independence). Several projects aiming to create androids that look, and, to a certain degree, speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway. Japanese roboticshave been leading the field since the 1970s.[12]Waseda Universityinitiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the first android, a full-scale humanoid intelligent robot.[13][14]Its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, usingtactile sensors. Its vision system allowed it to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system allowed it to communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.[14][15][16] In 1984, WABOT-2 was revealed, and made a number of improvements. It was capable of playing the organ. Wabot-2 had ten fingers and two feet, and was able to read a score of music. It was also able to accompany a person.[17]In 1986,Hondabegan its humanoid research and development program, to create humanoid robots capable of interacting successfully with humans.[18] The Intelligent Robotics Lab, directed byHiroshi IshiguroatOsaka University, and the Kokoro company demonstrated theActroidatExpo 2005inAichi Prefecture, Japan and released theTelenoid R1in 2010. In 2006, Kokoro developed a newDER 2android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165 cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The \"air servosystem\" which Kokoro developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice. The Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at theTokyo University of Science, has developed an android head calledSaya, which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 inYokohama, Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya isworkingat the Science University of Tokyo as a guide. TheWaseda University(Japan) andNTT docomo's manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robotWD-2. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing threedegrees of freedom. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To \"copy\" a face, they need only a3D scannerto determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask. Prof Nadia Thalmann, a Nanyang Technological University scientist, directed efforts of the Institute for Media Innovation along with the School of Computer Engineering in the development of a social robot, Nadine. Nadine is powered by software similar to Apple'sSirior Microsoft'sCortana. Nadine may become a personal assistant in offices and homes in future, or she may become a companion for the young and the elderly. Assoc Prof Gerald Seet from the School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering and the BeingThere Centre led a three-year R&D development intele-presence robotics, creating EDGAR. A remote user can control EDGAR with the user's face and expressions displayed on the robot's face in real time. The robot also mimics their upper body movements.[19] KITECHresearched and developedEveR-1, an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial \"musculature\" and capable of rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words. She is160 cmtall and weighs50 kg, matching the average figure of a Korean woman in her twenties. EveR-1's name derives from theBiblical Eve, plus the letterrforrobot. EveR-1's advanced computing processing power enablesspeech recognitionand vocal synthesis, at the same time processinglip synchronizationand visual recognition by 90-degree micro-CCDcameras withface recognition technology. An independent microchip inside her artificial brain handles gesture expression, body coordination, and emotion expression. Her whole body is made of highly advanced synthetic jelly silicon and with 60 artificial joints in her face, neck, and lower body; she is able to demonstrate realistic facial expressions and sing while simultaneously dancing. In South Korea, theMinistry of Information and Communicationhad an ambitious plan to put a robot in every household by 2020.[20]Several robot cities have been planned for the country: the first will be built in 2016 at a cost of 500 billion won (US$440 million), of which 50 billion is direct government investment.[21]The new robot city will feature research and development centers for manufacturers and part suppliers, as well as exhibition halls and a stadium for robot competitions. The country's new Robotics Ethics Charter will establish ground rules and laws for human interaction with robots in the future, setting standards for robotics users and manufacturers, as well as guidelines on ethical standards to be programmed into robots to prevent human abuse of robots and vice versa.[22] Walt Disney and a staff ofImagineerscreatedGreat Moments with Mr. Lincolnthat debuted at the1964 New York World's Fair.[23] Dr. William Barry, an Education Futurist and former visiting West Point Professor of Philosophy and Ethical Reasoning at theUnited States Military Academy, created an AI android character named \"Maria Bot\". This Interface AI android was named after the infamous fictional robot Maria in the 1927 filmMetropolis, as a well-behaved distant relative. Maria Bot is the first AI Android Teaching Assistant at the university level.[24][25]Maria Bot has appeared as a keynote speaker as a duo with Barry for a TEDx talk in Everett, Washington in February 2020.[26] Resembling a human from the shoulders up, Maria Bot is a virtual being android that has complex facial expressions and head movement and engages in conversation about a variety of subjects. She uses AI to process and synthesize information to make her own decisions on how to talk and engage. She collects data through conversations, direct data inputs such as books or articles, and through internet sources. Maria Bot was built by an international high-tech company for Barry to help improve education quality and eliminate education poverty. Maria Bot is designed to create new ways for students to engage and discuss ethical issues raised by the increasing presence of robots and artificial intelligence. Barry also uses Maria Bot to demonstrate that programming a robot with life-affirming, ethical framework makes them more likely to help humans to do the same.[27] Maria Bot is an ambassador robot for good and ethical AI technology.[28] Hanson Robotics, Inc., of Texas andKAISTproduced an android portrait ofAlbert Einstein, using Hanson's facial android technology mounted on KAIST's life-size walking bipedal robot body. This Einstein android, also called \"Albert Hubo\", thus represents the first full-body walking android in history.[29]Hanson Robotics, the FedEx Institute of Technology,[30]and the University of Texas at Arlington also developed the android portrait of sci-fi authorPhilip K. Dick(creator ofDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the basis for the filmBlade Runner), with full conversational capabilities that incorporated thousands of pages of the author's works.[31]In 2005, the PKD android won a first-placeartificial intelligenceaward fromAAAI. Androids are a staple of science fiction.Isaac Asimovpioneered the fictionalization of the science ofroboticsandartificial intelligence, notably in his 1950s seriesI, Robot.[32]One thing common to most fictional androids is that the real-life technological challenges associated with creating thoroughly human-like robots — such as the creation ofstrong artificial intelligence—are assumed to have been solved.[33]Fictional androids are often depicted as mentally and physically equal or superior to humans—moving, thinking and speaking as fluidly as them.[3][33] The tension between the nonhuman substance and the human appearance—or even human ambitions—of androids is the dramatic impetus behind most of their fictional depictions.[4][33]Some android heroes seek, likePinocchio, to become human, as in the filmBicentennial Man,[33]orDatainStar Trek: The Next Generation. Others, as in the filmWestworld, rebel against abuse by careless humans.[33]Android hunterDeckardinDo Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?and its film adaptationBlade Runnerdiscovers that his targets appear to be, in some ways, more \"human\" than he is.[33]Android stories, therefore, are not essentially stories \"about\" androids; they are stories about thehuman conditionand what it means to be human.[33] One aspect of writing about the meaning of humanity is to use discrimination against androids as a mechanism for exploring racism in society, as inBlade Runner.[34]Perhaps the clearest example of this isJohn Brunner's1968 novelInto the Slave Nebula, where the blue-skinned android slaves are explicitly shown to be fully human.[35]More recently, the androidsBishopand Annalee Call in the filmsAliensandAlien Resurrectionare used as vehicles for exploring how humans deal with the presence of an \"Other\".[36]The 2018 video gameDetroit: Become Humanalso explores how androids are treated as second class citizens in a near future society. Female androids, or \"gynoids\", are often seen in science fiction, and can be viewed as a continuation of the long tradition of men attempting to create the stereotypical \"perfect woman\".[37]Examples include theGreek mythofPygmalionandthe female robot MariainFritz Lang'sMetropolis. Some gynoids, like Pris inBlade Runner, are designed as sex-objects, with the intent of \"pleasing men's violent sexual desires\",[38]or as submissive, servile companions, such as inThe Stepford Wives. Fiction about gynoids has therefore been described as reinforcing \"essentialist ideas of femininity\",[39]although others have suggested that the treatment of androids is a way of exploring racism andmisogynyin society.[40] The 2015 Japanese filmSayonara, starringGeminoid F, was promoted as \"the first movie to feature an android performing opposite a human actor\".[41] Actroid Android science Animatronics Audio-Animatronics Automaton Cyborg Domestic robot Gynoid Humanoid robot Neurorobotics Replicant Synthoid Uncanny valley ^Van Riper, A.
